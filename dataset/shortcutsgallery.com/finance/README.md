All clothing items in dictionary are set to Fahrenheit. This script will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. So keep clothing items in Fahrenheit for it to work properly You can change the output to four different styles. Just change the variable at the end to the style you want. Right now it is to show text which can not show all the information until you tap the text. I like to have it send to me as an iMessage. Option 1: Day should wear concise: This one will give you what to wear and times wherever your outfit changes. This will make sure your prepared for any time the temperature changes but can be lengthy compared to Minimalism Option 2: Day should wear detailed: Same as above but adds weather details Option 3: Minimalism: This one will only give you three different times Morning, Afternoon, Evening and what to wear based on those times.

Sie k√∂nnen den Rechnungsbetrag eingeben und, falls er nicht enthalten ist und Sie dies w√ºnschen, ein prozentuales Trinkgeld oder einen festen Betrag Ihrer Wahl hinzuf√ºgen und die Rechnung dann gleichm√§√üig auf alle Zahlenden aufteilen. Le permite ingresar el monto de la factura y, si no est√° incluido y se siente tan inclinado, agregar una propina porcentual o un monto fijo de su elecci√≥n y luego dividir la factura en partes iguales entre todos los que pagan.

### Name: PIN Generator

- URL: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/562a538f6c064b6bb398652f4e8ca867

- Source: https://shortcutsgallery.com

- Description: Simply install the Shortcut, specify a 4 digit number, can be memorable like a year of birth or completely random. The number must be kept the same otherwise your PINs will all change. Then use the last 4 numbers of any card to generate a unique PIN. Once you‚Äôve changed the card‚Äôs PIN to the one PIN Generator gives you you‚Äôll never have to remember it again. Every time you need the PIN simply enter the last 4 digits to retrieve the PIN. You can now keep a different PIN for each and every card meaning that if you ever lost or had your wallet or purse stolen, you do at least have different PINs for each card. One word of caution ‚Äì it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to use this shortcut via Siri as you don‚Äôt want your PIN read out load‚Ä¶ unless of course you‚Äôre wearing headphones.

- Description: This pay widget does 2 things. on Venmo, CashApp, and PayPal and Google Pay, it looks at your user send link (venmo URL or cash.me link for example) and generates a QR code for anyone with you to scan and send you money. With Google Pay however, you just provide your email address. next, it allows you to send money directly to someone using the built in measures for CashApp, Venmo, and Apple Pay. With apple pay, since you cant give someone a reference link, it just lets you request from someone. once this is installed, look through the shortcut and fill in the information. for the QR codes. feel free to add or remove services too. NOTE: Google pay and PayPal both dont let you send money to someone through Shortcuts yet. once that is enabled, i will be adding that in there. here is it in action!
