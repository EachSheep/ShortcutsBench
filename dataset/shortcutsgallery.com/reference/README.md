- Description: What to wear based on temperature v1.3 1.3 changes Added two different dictionaries for whatever temperature you use This is a script that will tell you what to wear based on feels like temperature throughout the day. This is an updated version of what I shared before. You can personalize what to wear based on temperatures by adjusting the clothing dictionary and adjust the output too. All clothing items in dictionary are set to Fahrenheit. This script will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. So keep clothing items in Fahrenheit for it to work properly You can change the output to four different styles. Just change the variable at the end to the style you want. Right now it is to show text which can not show all the information until you tap the text. I like to have it send to me as an iMessage. Option 1: Day should wear concise: This one will give you what to wear and times wherever your outfit changes. This will make sure your prepared for any time the temperature changes but can be lengthy compared to Minimalism Option 2: Day should wear detailed: Same as above but adds weather details Option 3: Minimalism: This one will only give you three different times Morning, Afternoon, Evening and what to wear based on those times. Option 4: Minimalism detailed: Same as above but adds weather information.

- Description: When you are a creative person and dont have a scribe or the time to grab a pen and paper or simply your notes app. You can just say it out loud and all your words will be put in a folder of your choice. Prefferably a separate folder in your notes app.  I got this idea from myself. I sometimes talk to myself especially during the pandemic and aome of those things i say are worth writing down but i never have the time to type them in by hand as i speak so this will definitely help me.  And i hope some of you will find it helpful as well. Tip: edit the dictate settings in this shortcut to the language you use before using the shortcut.

- Description: When you are applying to jobs online and its too much work to write them down on a piece of paper and then copy it to your notes for record tracking. This shortcut will make sure that your time isnt wasted when you really want a job and you dont have anytime to waste.  If i were you i would put in your home address when it asks you for the address so you know which job is closest to you. I hope you enjoy it!  It makes my life much better when my parents ask me for my applications and I actually have something to give to them as proof. Plus some employers will ask you where you found them and what other places have you looked at.
