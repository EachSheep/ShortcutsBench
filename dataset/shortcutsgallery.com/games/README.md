- Description: 📋 Welcome to Clipster! The ultimate clipboard manager shortcut for ios! I created this shortcut because it’s hard to find a free clipboard manager on ios that’s not littered with ads, so I decided to create one for myself If you face any issues or have a recommendation for a feature, don’t hesitate to open an issue on Github! https://github.com/TheXploler/Clipster Thanks 😊

Enough trying to translate from French!
(My English is not very good, so some things are repetitive and some words can be inexistants!)
The tutorial is simply called “Points Clicker – English Tuto”.
Some features are displayed in the tutorial but they aren’t in the game, unless I add them 🙂
Well, enjoy!

- Description: What to wear based on temperature v1.3 1.3 changes Added two different dictionaries for whatever temperature you use This is a script that will tell you what to wear based on feels like temperature throughout the day. This is an updated version of what I shared before. You can personalize what to wear based on temperatures by adjusting the clothing dictionary and adjust the output too. All clothing items in dictionary are set to Fahrenheit. This script will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. So keep clothing items in Fahrenheit for it to work properly You can change the output to four different styles. Just change the variable at the end to the style you want. Right now it is to show text which can not show all the information until you tap the text. I like to have it send to me as an iMessage. Option 1: Day should wear concise: This one will give you what to wear and times wherever your outfit changes. This will make sure your prepared for any time the temperature changes but can be lengthy compared to Minimalism Option 2: Day should wear detailed: Same as above but adds weather details Option 3: Minimalism: This one will only give you three different times Morning, Afternoon, Evening and what to wear based on those times. Option 4: Minimalism detailed: Same as above but adds weather information.
