Right now it is to show text which can not show all the information until you tap the text. I like to have it send to me as an iMessage.

This will make sure your prepared for any time the temperature changes but can be lengthy compared to Minimalism Option 2: Day should wear detailed: Same as above but adds weather details Option 3: Minimalism: This one will only give you three different times Morning, Afternoon, Evening and what to wear based on those times.
