- Description: This shortcut can be used for comparing 2 different sized pizzas. You have to input a currency (that‚Äôs only formal, as it doesn‚Äôt really matter in terms of calculating), and the diameters and prices of the 2 pizzas. It determines, which is worth buying based on price per cm2, and which is bigger by how many times. Note that this calculates in centimetres, but if I‚Äôm correct, you can input inches too, the only problem is that it‚Äôs outputting ‚Äúcm‚Äù, but the numbers should be right.
