- Description: What to wear based on temperature v1.3 1.3 changes Added two different dictionaries for whatever temperature you use This is a script that will tell you what to wear based on feels like temperature throughout the day. This is an updated version of what I shared before. You can personalize what to wear based on temperatures by adjusting the clothing dictionary and adjust the output too. All clothing items in dictionary are set to Fahrenheit. This script will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. So keep clothing items in Fahrenheit for it to work properly You can change the output to four different styles. Just change the variable at the end to the style you want. Right now it is to show text which can not show all the information until you tap the text. I like to have it send to me as an iMessage. Option 1: Day should wear concise: This one will give you what to wear and times wherever your outfit changes. This will make sure your prepared for any time the temperature changes but can be lengthy compared to Minimalism Option 2: Day should wear detailed: Same as above but adds weather details Option 3: Minimalism: This one will only give you three different times Morning, Afternoon, Evening and what to wear based on those times. Option 4: Minimalism detailed: Same as above but adds weather information.

- Description: What does this shortcut do?
It converts the screenshot from png format to heic format and in almost every case it reduces the file size by 10-30 times. Once it verifies that all the screenshots have been converted then the shortcut will delete the original screenshots (although you can find the deleted screenshots in the ‚Äúrecently deleted‚Äù in photos app, if for any reason you want to recover the original screenshots). After that‚Äôs done it also shows a notification with how much space the original screenshot took and how much space the new converted screenshots take and how many screenshots were converted. Prerequisite :
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. Create an album in photos app with the name ‚ÄúCompressed Screenshots‚Äù PS :
-If you have a large number of Screenshots, it will take a significant of time for them to be converted and saved and then deleted so be patient during your first time using this and if possible just clear out and close all other apps and maybe restart your phone before starting the process (only for the first time and only if you have hundreds or thousands of screenshots).
-Go into Settings > Shortcuts > Advanced and then enable all the option EXCEPT ‚ÄúAllow running Scripts‚Äù (that‚Äôs not necessary for this shortcut)
-Allow the shortcut to access/save/delete a multiple images when you run the shortcut for the first time.
-Also note that for some reason even though preverse metadata toggle is on while converting, the new compressed screenshots
