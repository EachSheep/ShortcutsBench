All clothing items in dictionary are set to Fahrenheit. This script will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. So keep clothing items in Fahrenheit for it to work properly You can change the output to four different styles. Just change the variable at the end to the style you want. Right now it is to show text which can not show all the information until you tap the text. I like to have it send to me as an iMessage. Option 1: Day should wear concise: This one will give you what to wear and times wherever your outfit changes. This will make sure your prepared for any time the temperature changes but can be lengthy compared to Minimalism Option 2: Day should wear detailed: Same as above but adds weather details Option 3: Minimalism: This one will only give you three different times Morning, Afternoon, Evening and what to wear based on those times.

So you know how much exactly you will pay.
You can change the bank fees easily.
Did i mention its online?
And you can add any currency you would like?
Very useful specially when traveling

### Name: PIN Generator

- URL: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/562a538f6c064b6bb398652f4e8ca867

- Source: https://shortcutsgallery.com

- Description: Simply install the Shortcut, specify a 4 digit number, can be memorable like a year of birth or completely random. The number must be kept the same otherwise your PINs will all change. Then use the last 4 numbers of any card to generate a unique PIN. Once you’ve changed the card’s PIN to the one PIN Generator gives you you’ll never have to remember it again. Every time you need the PIN simply enter the last 4 digits to retrieve the PIN. You can now keep a different PIN for each and every card meaning that if you ever lost or had your wallet or purse stolen, you do at least have different PINs for each card. One word of caution – it’s probably not a good idea to use this shortcut via Siri as you don’t want your PIN read out load… unless of course you’re wearing headphones. Paul Thomson @Tech4Parents
