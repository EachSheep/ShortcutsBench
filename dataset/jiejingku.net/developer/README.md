1- How much does it cost to use ChatGPT? During the initial research preview period, ChatGPT was free to use.
2- How does ChatGPT work? ChatGPT is fine-tuned based on GPT-3.5, a language model trained to generate text. ChatGPT is optimized for dialogues using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) - a method that uses human demonstrations to guide the model towards desired behavior.
3- Why does artificial intelligence appear so real and lifelike? These models are trained on a large amount of data from the internet, including dialogues written by humans, making their responses sound human-like. It is important to remember that this is a direct result of the system design (maximizing similarity between outputs and training data) and such outputs may sometimes be inaccurate, unrealistic, or misleading.
4- Can I trust that AI is telling the truth? ChatGPT is not connected to the internet and may occasionally provide incorrect answers. Its knowledge of the world and events after 2021 is limited, and it may occasionally generate harmful instructions or biased content. We recommend verifying the accuracy of the model's responses. If you find answers to be incorrect, please provide feedback using the "unsatisfied" button.
5- Who can view my conversations? As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, conversations are reviewed to improve our system and ensure compliance with our policies and security requirements.
6- Will you use my conversations for training? Yes. Our AI trainers may review your conversations to improve our system.
7- Can you delete specific prompts? No, we are unable to delete specific prompts from your chat history. Please refrain from sharing any sensitive information in conversations.
8- Can I view the history of my threads? How can I save the conversations I have had? Currently, you cannot view the history of your conversations, but this is a feature we are exploring.

### Name: URL Encoding is a method used to represent and transfer data over the Internet.

- URL: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d61ca17624034011a1c2cb267c326c79

- Source: https://jiejingku.net

- Description: This shortcut can be used for encoding and decoding URLs. URL encoding, also known as percent-encoding, is a method of encoding non-alphanumeric characters into a format that can be safely transmitted in a URL. This encoding format is particularly useful for transmitting characters with special meanings in a URL or characters that cannot be directly transmitted (such as spaces, colons, forward slashes, etc.). In URL encoding, non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with a percent sign (%) followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the character's ASCII code. For example, a space is encoded as "%20" and a forward slash (/) is encoded as "%2F". The main purpose of this encoding method is to ensure the integrity of the URL, preventing incorrect parsing or processing of the URL due to special characters or encoding issues during network transmission. For example, if a URL query string parameter contains a space, it must be encoded as "%20" to ensure that the receiving end can parse the URL correctly.
