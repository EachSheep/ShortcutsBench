### Name: URL Encoding

- URL: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d61ca17624034011a1c2cb267c326c79

- Source: https://jiejingku.net

- Description: This shortcut can be used to encode and decode URLs. URL encoding, also known as percent-encoding, is a method of encoding non-alphanumeric characters into a format that can be safely transmitted in a URL. This encoding format is especially useful for transmitting characters that have special meanings in a URL or characters that cannot be directly transmitted (such as spaces, colons, forward slashes, etc.). In URL encoding, non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by a percentage sign (%) followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the character's ASCII code. For example, a space is encoded as "%20" and a forward slash (/) is encoded as "%2F". 

The main purpose of this encoding method is to ensure the integrity of the URL, preventing incorrect parsing or processing of the URL due to special meanings or encoding issues of certain characters during network transmission. For instance, if a URL's query string parameter contains a space, it must be encoded as "%20" to ensure that the URL can be correctly parsed by the recipient.

- Source: https://jiejingku.net

- Description: Extract.pics is an easy-to-use website image download tool. It allows you to extract, view, and download images from any public website. Simply paste the website's URL into the search box, then click "Extract" to start the process. The extraction process takes a few seconds to ensure finding as many images as possible. Once complete, you will see all the images in an organized grid. You can explore the found images by sorting them by size, width, height, or their order of appearance. Additionally, you can search for images by name, size, or type/file format, making it easy to find the image you need. You can also use the zoom tool to inspect images on a light or dark background, download individual images, and copy the image's URL. If you want to download multiple images at once, select all the images you need and download them all to a ZIP archive. The website is completely free to use! Each time the extraction process is initiated, a new Google Chrome browser instance is launched on the server. The browser then navigates to the website you input and detects all images (visible and invisible). Tracking pixels and other unnecessary images on the website will be removed. The remaining images are analyzed to display useful information such as type and size. The browsing behavior of each website is similar to how you would browse them in a browser. We use the latest version of the Google Chrome browser to process the websites you provide. After loading your website, we execute JavaScript and wait for all requests to complete before starting the extraction process. After navigating to the website you provide, the server quickly scrolls down for a few seconds to find as many images as possible. Any images that load in the first 10 seconds are sent back to you. Tracking pixels and missing images are automatically removed. Once the extraction process is complete, you will find a list of all images found on the URL you provided. You can then download individual images using the button. If you want to download multiple images at once, you can select them by clicking on the images and then use the green "Download Selected Images" button to download all the selected images to a ZIP file. This may take a few seconds (or even minutes) depending on the number of images chosen. In some cases, it may even fail. If this happens, try downloading fewer images at once. If extraction fails, there could be several reasons. First, check if the URL you entered is correct. If it still doesn't work, check if any of the following issues are present:

- Description: AI artificial intelligence image enlargement, BIGJPG uses the latest artificial intelligence deep learning technology - deep convolutional neural network. It will fill in the noisy and jagged parts to achieve lossless image enlargement. Supports WIN, MacOS, iOS, Android, and mini-program clients. Official website: https://bigjpg.com/zh Using other enlargement methods such as PS or PhotoZoom, the enlarged images still have noticeable blurriness, edge artifacts, and noise. The working principle of our product is to use neural networks to make special algorithm adjustments for the line, color, dot, and other characteristics of the enlarged image, so the enlargement effect is very outstanding, with good color retention, no jagged edges, and edge artifacts. More importantly, the noise affecting the image quality is basically not visible in the enlarged image. The enlargement of anime and illustration images can be said to be perfect. After enlarging small images, the effect on color, detail, and edges is excellent. It also supports enlarging ordinary photos. Currently, the free version is 3000x3000px, 5M; the paid version is 50M. After starting the enlargement, the estimated processing time will be displayed. Depending on the enlargement factor and image size, the enlargement time will vary, ranging from a few minutes to tens of minutes. Generally, the actual enlargement time is slightly shorter than the estimated time. Due to the influence of network environment and the number of users using the server at the same time, there is a small chance of enlargement failure. If you encounter this situation, please try again in a few minutes. If you are not logged in, you need to keep the browser open all the time, otherwise the enlarged image will be lost. If you are already logged in, you can close the browser, as we support offline enlargement, and you can download it later. After logging in, you can record and view your history. Rest assured, the images uploaded by users and the enlarged images will be automatically deleted after 5 days. Image address links are encrypted and saved, and unless you actively share them, others will not be able to view the images.

- Description: Xigua is a personalized news reading platform created by the team under ByteDance, where you can subscribe to the information you need through keyword rules and information subscription sources, meeting your personalized reading needs. The slogan of the Xigua App is "Define your reading universe." In simple terms, this is a product that allows you to customize your reading. Currently, Xigua is still in the beta testing phase, and after registering on your phone, you will need to enter an invitation code to officially join Xigua. Each new user who successfully registers can get 3 invitation codes. To facilitate the use of the Xigua APP, the Shortcut Library has organized a mutual assistance relay activity for invitation codes. You can obtain Xigua invitation codes through the following WeChat contact (requires friend verification: Xigua invitation code). Of course, to ensure the smooth progress of the activity, after you successfully register, you need to return two invitation codes for subsequent relay invitations. Compared to the officially claimed "intelligent reading universe," Xigua's logic is more like a traditional forum. In Xigua, all content is divided into different "Xigua," which are different "forums" or "groups." The content in each "Xigua" is related to the theme and discussions. At the bottom of the sidebar, you can find the entrance to "Discover Xigua," which aggregates official and user-created Xigua. You can scroll through this page endlessly, find the Xigua you are interested in, browse, and join; or you can search for the Xigua you are interested in at the top by "Search Xigua." If you don't find the Xigua you are interested in, you can also find the option to "Create Xigua" in the sidebar. The process of creating Xigua is very simple, just fill in the name, description, and set the header image. Xigua also provides guidance for newcomers called "District Heads" to easily and quickly complete Xigua Bot's content subscription. Xigua offers two ways to browse posts: "Recommended" and "Latest." You can choose to get the most popular or newest content as needed. Don't worry about the algorithm pushing endless content to you; here, you will only see content added by the "District Heads" to the Bot subscription list and posts and links shared by users. If you are not satisfied with getting information and want to share content or opinions, Xigua provides various ways to participate in discussions. You can reply to posts, publish posts, share links, and have friendly exchanges with users who have subscribed to this Xigua. In the recommended section, you can see recommendations from some Xigua and posts from different Xigua. Here, you can temporarily leave your areas of interest and discover more new content and viewpoints. "Lighting up" is like liking + saving. Here, you can find the content you've "lit up" in all Xiguas and the thoughts you leave when you light up (you can choose whether to sync thoughts to the comment section).
