No, you only need to register or log in to the OneKey Card website, complete identity verification, recharge the digital asset address of the card you own for use, and it will be converted into USD for spending according to the exchange rate at the time of recharge. During the public testing phase, only USDC recharge is available, and we cannot resolve recharging with the wrong token. It is not. This is a prepaid card and cannot be overdrawn. Before your funds are transferred from the OneKey wallet, they remain assets in self-custody mode. Once transferred to the OneKey Card account, they will no longer be in self-custody mode. When digital assets are received in the OneKey Card account, they will be converted to USD and transferred to the issuing institution, such as Visa or MasterCard. There is no limit on the amount, and the single transaction limit is 50000 USD. The address at 5 W 5th St Room 34027 Los Angeles, CA 90013 is the initial address of the card 4288 and can be used for filling in the billing address.
