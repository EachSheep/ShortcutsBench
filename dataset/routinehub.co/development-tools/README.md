You can use the main dictionary, it doesn't matter!To check for the latest updates using RoutineHub, you can reference the text below:As shown in the picture:To check for the latest updates using ShareShortcuts, you can reference the text below:As shown in the picture:To check for the latest updates using a privately hostedJSONfile, you can reference the text below:As shown in the picture:Bulk Search is R⤓Updater’s bread and butter, allowing you to check all of your Shortcuts for updates at once. This is achieved by parsing every Shortcut in your library and fetching the data stored in a ”Comment Action” at the top or Anywhere. This is the only thing you’ll need to add in order forR⤓Updaterto fetch the latest updates from RoutineHub.To check for the latest updates using RoutineHub, you can reference the text below:To check for the latest updates using ShareShortcuts, you can reference the text below:To check for the latest updates using a privately hostedJSONfile, you can reference the text below:To ensure your privately hosted JSON file is in the correct format, I recommend usingTHISShortcut to create it.This means that you can use all dictionaries whether you are using RoutineHub or ShareShortcuts, such as:There are a lot of codes you can use there is no "condition" and if there is a dictionary that does not support it, report me about it so that I can add or fix itMagic and functionality is possible because of R⤓Updater Engine, this JavaScript Engine allows R⤓Updater to recognizeUpdatesfromRollbacks, one decimal from multi decimal and numbers from words. Like:Do you want to publish your shortcut in another place? Like ShareShortcuts or in your Server? Ok, it’s alright, R⤓Updater supports the 2 most famous Shortcut Sharing Websites and even your server if you want it too!Check for updates supports multi-decimal version numbers and Alphabetical Versions.Your version numbers on RoutineHub must match the version in your dictionary. Version numbers are numbers such as1.5.2or2.1or.6, any value with multiple numbers and decimals.R⤓Updater is one of the few updaters that support all the type of versions, since normal versions like1.40to multi decimal5.9.4and fully worded versions like-alpha-,-beta-,-build-,-test-or-secret-, no matter what version you put, R⤓Updater will always show you that you have an Update or a Rollback.Note: The word must be inside-like:"-HERE-"Beta Updates are an optional feature for creators that applies the same simplicity towards beta version of their Shortcuts. This will finally allowing users an easily solution to finding and installing the latest (beta) versions of their favourite Shortcuts. This will work seamlessly.Build Numbers are an optional feature for creators that was designed to work perfectly alongside beta updates. This will allow you to maintain the version number of an upcoming release while still pushing updates to your beta testers. When you’re done with the version you can simply remove the build numbers and R⤓Updater will recognise this is a new update, not a rollback.As you can see from the examples below, build numbers are created by adding”-TEXT-NUMBER”. You may replace the first part with any text you like or you can use“alpha”and“beta”which is recommended. The second part is your build number, simply start from 1 and work your way up until you’re ready to release the update to everybody, at which point you will remove all additional data and return the a standard version.10.0-alpha-17— UPDATE —10.0-beta-110.0-beta-12— Rollback —10.0-alpha-1210.0-beta-1— UPDATE —10.03.0— Rollback —3.0-alpha-1210.0-secret-12— UPDATE —10.010.0-build-24— ROLLBACK —10.0-test-18Updaters with Update Engines are more stable and work better than updaters without update engines or updaters with 0Masking.Shortcuts without Update Engine or shortcuts with 0Masking cannot distinguish between Update or Rollback !!! Which means that the shortcuts that use theEngineare able to know if it is anUpdateor aRollback!!Do you want to run specific actions depending on what the user have chosen? When R⤓Updater stops running, it will output some result codes.You can get the information about an update or know what R⤓Updater version the user is running using R⤓Updater API, there are 2 API's:Get Info- Get information about an update if it is available.Check Version- Get the version of R⤓Updater that the user is running.Graphics made withMediaKit11.5 - Aug. 27, 2022, 12:32 a.m.Bugs fixed- Created on iOS 15.6.1- Released at 27‏/08‏/2022- POWERED BY R⤓UpdaterLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackUpdateHub was designed to keep all of your Shortcuts up to date without the requirement of running them individually.Graphics byMediaKit28-7-2019:Due to the changes made by Apple in the latest version of their operating system, any Shortcut created using iOS 13 (and iPadOS) will no longer be compatible with earlier versions such as iOS 12.Bulk Search is UpdateHub’s bread and butter, allowing you to check all of your Shortcuts for updates at once. This is achieved by parsing every Shortcut in your library and fetching the data stored in a”Comment Action”at the top. This is the only thing you’ll need to add in order for UpdateHub to fetch the latest updates from RoutineHub or a privately hosted json file.Manual Search is an optional method to manually check RoutineHub or a privately hosted json file for the latest update. This will only check the Shortcut you’re currently running and is lightning fast. This is achieved by a”Text Action”with the name of your Shortcut and the”Run Shortcut Action”linking to UpdateHub.Sometimes things break and us creators sometimes scramble trying to fix a broken update and publish a new version ASAP. To combat this issue, UpdateHub has support for rolling back an update. If there’s something wrong with a version currently accessible via RoutineHub and you delete it or you update your privately hosted json file, anybody who has already downloaded it will be notified to downgrade the next time they check for an update.Beta Updates are an optional feature for creators that applies the same simplicity towards beta version of their Shortcuts. This will finally allowing users an easily solution to finding and installing the latest (beta) versions of their favourite Shortcuts. This will work seamlessly alongside Bulk Search and will only require an extension to the required”Comment Action”at the top of your Shortcut.Build Numbers are an optional feature for creators that was designed to work perfectly alongside beta updates. This will allow you to maintain the version number of an upcoming release while still pushing updates to your beta testers. When you’re done with the version you can simply remove the build numbers and UpdateHub will recognise this is a new update, not a rollback.Localisation brings UpdateHub to your native language, which is all possible thanks to TranslateHub. If you have TranslateHub added to your Shortcuts the next time you run UpdateHub, it will be automatically translated to your preferred language of choice ad continue working as you would expect it to.Below you will find detailed instructions on how to implement UpdateHub into your Shortcuts. This includes options for hosting your updates on RoutineHub or privately hosting them. You will also find an extra (optional) step to manually check for an update through your Shortcut. This step can also be used to automatically check for updates every 24 hours, you can see an example of this in theDEMOprovided.Multi-decimal version numbers are supported all thanks to the brilliant mind UpdateKit, the first updater Shortcut for iOS. Mike Beasley recently updated his Shortcut to version 4.0, where he developed a script that will quickly compare two versions. UpdateKit Engine 1.1 is one of the most efficient ways to do this. UpdateHub may use a heavily modified version of the script, but without it multi-decimal version numbers wouldn’t be supported. To learn more about UpdateKit and UpdateKit Engine, you can follow the link provided below.Learn MoreAs you can see from the examples below, build numbers are created by adding”-TEXT-NUMBER”. You may replace the first part with any text you like or you can use“alpha”and“beta”which is recommended. The second part is your build number, simply start from 1 and work your way up until you’re ready to release the update to everybody, at which point you will remove all additional data and return the a standard version.Note:This feature currently requires an update from RoutineHub in order to work correctly. There is a limit of 10 character per version which unfortunately, isn’t enough. Once this limit is lifted, this feature will work as expected.2.0-alpha-17— UPDATE —2.0-beta-12.0-beta-1— UPDATE —2.02.0-build-24— ROLLBACK —2.0-test-182.0-secret-12— UPDATE —2.0Adding UpdateHub’s Bulk Search to your Shortcuts is quite possibly the easiest thing you’ll ever do. All UpdateHub requires from you to implement Bulk Search is a”Comment Action”at the top of your Shortcut.Due to the way UpdateHub fetches data from this comment, you may add some information about your Shortcut above the required text. Please keep this to a maximum of 4 lines in total to ensure UpdateHub can still find the data.To check for the latest updates using RoutineHub, you can reference the text below:To check for the latest beta updates using RoutineHub, you can reference the text below:To check for the latest updates using a privately hosted JSON file, you can reference the text below:To check for the latest beta updates using a privately hosted JSON file, you can reference the text below:To ensure your privately hosted JSON file is in the correct format, I recommend usingTHISShortcut to create it.To add a manual search to your Shortcut, use aText Actioncontaining the name of your Shortcut then add theRun Shortcut Actionlinking to UpdateHub.When you check updates manually through your Shortcut, you’ll be returned with a json file containing the version of UpdateHub and 3 types of response codes.When no updates are found, the result value will return “NO-UPDATE”. In addition to this, UpdateHub will also send a notification to the user to inform them that they’re up to date.If an update has been found and the user has chosen to install it, the result value will return “UPDATE”. I highly recommend adding anExit Shortcut Actionif you are returned this code.If an update has been found and the user has chosen to skip it, the result value will return “SKIP-UPDATE”.If there was a problem parsing data from the requiredComment Action, the result value will return “ERROR”.If you feel UpdateHub is the right fit for you and your Shortcuts, you may use the following on your RoutineHub page.[![UpdateHub](https://i.imgur.com/om4hpSU.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2066)If you experience any issues or require assistance with this shortcut, please contact me via Reddit and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.2.0.1 - Sept. 24, 2019, 5:27 a.m.Welcome to UpdateHub 2.0! This update brings over 300 reworked actions to make room for a plethora of new features such as localisation and betas.. with an even smaller action count!

- Description: DescriptionLearn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn moreLatest Release NotesFeedbackMediaKit was developed for the makers of shortcuts. You spend hours of time to create and develop shortcuts. You shouldn't spend another hour or more presenting your work. MediaKit offers you everything you need to showcase your shortcuts (especially here on RoutineHub).Create banners with the background color of your shortcut, the name and a short description or a slogan to introduce your shortcut.Generate mockups with your screenshots and the frames of 50 iPhone devices.Generate mockups with your screenshots and the frames of 34 iPad devices.After you have created your mockups, you can merge several graphics into one. You have the choice to arrange them horizontally, vertically or as a grid.You have created a video for your shortcut and want to link it with highest attention? Create a YouTube-, Vimeo- or RoutineHub-Player with or without a video poster and link the graphic to your video.Create your own Apple-style badges, for example to draw attention to which app is needed to use your shortcut. Or link another shortcut which is needed to use yours. You can also use this feature to show that you are the author.With My MediaKit you always have your personal MediaKit collection at hand. Store and manage your graphics and retrieve them easily at any time.MediaKit Markup is no witchcraft, it’s just another way to edit your mockups. This part of MediaKit uses Apple’s Markup tool that’ve probably used before. Add notes with Markup, use geometric shapes to highlight areas and so on—anything Apple’s Markup can do.Prepare your graphics for uploading to Imgur and embedding on RoutineHub. This guarantees that all MediaKit graphics have an accurate size and fit perfectly into the RoutineHub page of your shortcut.MediaKit offers you the option to upload your graphics directly to Imgur. Images on RoutineHub are embedded with Markdown. MediaKit also takes care of this part for you. The code you need to embed images with Markdown is automatically generated from the direct links to your graphics. This code is copied to the clipboard so you can paste it directly to the RoutineHub page of your shortcut. The same goes with linked images like Video Players and Download Badges.One of the most important things in design is white space. MediaKit offers you five different sizes to optimise your RoutineHub page layout.Explore how to use MediaKit with a built-in User Guide.

- Description: DescriptionExample:Latest Release NotesFeedbackTranslateKit localizes your shortcut automatically. Your shortcut can be understood in almost any language using TranslateKit.Includes a built-in language picker with emoji country flags and translated language names.TranslateKit automatically detects the system language to localize the language picker and its menus. It puts the detected system language at the top of the language picker.Getting started with TranslateKit is as easy as 2 actions.Run TranslateKit towards the beginning of your shortcut using aRun Shortcutaction. Input aDictionaryaction withshortcut_name, andshortcut_idkeys. This will prompt the user to select a language to use for your shortcut. TheRun Shortcutaction will output the language they select. Keep in mind it will be in their system language.This sets up your Shortcut with TranslateKit.Duplicate those actions in your workflow but include atextkey with a dictionary type value. Fill this dictionary with key value pairs.When run, it returns a dictionary with the same keys, but with the values translated to the language the user selected.Refer to the full documentation for any further questions:https://translatekit.com/documentationTranslations are cached for quick retrieval so that if the text has not changed it won’t affect the speed of your shortcut. If it has changed, it will of course be translated again. If the input is already in the selected language, it is returned immediately.After the first run and cache, it’s just as fast as loading your own localizations except you didn't have to translate them!Refer to the full documentation for further details:https://translatekit.com/documentationHere is an optional to include on your RoutineHub page to let your users know to download TranslateKit if they haven't already.Just copy-paste the markdown below:TranslateKit requires a stable internet connection to translate or get cached translations from iCloud. Translation speed or loading the cache can be slow as a result of a poor connection. The original text is returned immediately when offline.TranslateKit detects the system language automatically to translate its internal menus, dialogues, and the names for languages. It doesnotuse Mail, Calendars or Location Services to detect your system language.TranslateKit uses the default translation actions to detect languages and translate text and dictionaries. This of course means that it is limited by what the actions support.Dependencies:UpdateKitVersions after 2.1.3 are not created using ScPL.2.2.0 - May 12, 2021, 2:02 a.m.- Added previously missing localizations for Hebrew, Filipino, and Ukrainian- Specifically corrected Filipino localization- Updated username in GitHub URLs- New menu item ‘Reset localizations & flags’. This will re-download the localizations and flags. It is recommended to do so after downloading this update.- Reworded some menus and messages- Updated tag line, improved documentation in description- New look for translatekit.com, better documentation.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis version ofBARThas been tested with iPadOS 14.5 and 14.6 beta 2.Unfortunately, withiOS 14.5(and thus far persisting with the earlyiOS 14.6 betas), Apple introduced a new bug that generates an error when some shortcuts are written to the local iCloud Drive. If yourbackupsandarchivesgenerate an error (specificallyAn error occurred in the destination for the data.), refer to theiOS 14.5 Write Errorsection below.2021-05-17 UPDATE: At least when tested with my long list of shortcuts, it appears that Apple has addressed this issue. Starting withiOS 14.6 beta 3(18F5065a), I no longer see this bug. To confirm that your shortcuts areclean, try runningIdentify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcutson your updated system. If you do not see an error, your set of shortcuts have been successfully written to iCloud.BARTis a shortcut that can back up, archive, and restore shortcuts in theShortcutsappLibrary, also known asMy Shortcuts. It is designed to be full-featured, yet simple and fast to use. In fact, most of the information below can be easily discovered by simply running the shortcut*. However if you prefer to read instructions and/or learn some of the finer points ofBART, the following is for you.* There are a few significant exceptions. For example, runningBARTfrom another shortcut, a very powerful yet easy to use feature, is not discoverable (unless you peer into the actions of theBART😀 ). Therefore, even if you have used the interactive features ofBART, you'll find some very useful information beginning with the sectionRunning BART From Another Shortcut.A video overview ofBARTis availablehere. Changes forVersion 2.0are highlighted inthis video.Short answer:It's always good to back up your work!Long answer:Stuffhappens! On occasion, the iOSShortcutsapp will display an error indicating that the database is corrupt. IfiCloud Sync(one of theShortcutsapp settings) is set, theShortcutsapp attempts to recreateMy Shortcutsafter the error dialog is dismissed. Depending on the circumstances, this restoration can range from acomplete recoveryto acomplete lossof all of the shortcuts inMy Shortcuts. If not acomplete recovery, shortcut backups are indispensable. Backups are also valuable during more common and frequent events, e.g., if a shortcut is mistakenly modified or deleted.In addition to shortcutprotection, backups can be employed tomanageshortcuts. For example, a user might find a group of shortcuts that are useful occasionally, but not want to clutterMy Shortcutswith these rarely used shortcuts. Such shortcuts could bearchivedandrestoredwhen needed.This section includes a short description for eachShortcut Operationon theBARTmain menu.Save Snapshot of My Shortcutssaves a copy of all shortcuts inMy Shortcutsto thesnapshotfolder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Snapshot/. All files previously in this folder are deleted before the shortcuts are copied to this folder. This is the fastest and simplest way toback upMy Shortcuts.Back Up Selectedsaves copy of one or more selected shortcuts inMy Shortcutsto thebackupfolder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Backup/. Shortcuts files in the folderare written overif the selection includes shortcuts with the same names.Shortcuts previously backed up to thebackupfolder and later deleted fromMy Shortcutsarenotautomatically deleted from thebackupfolder. Thus over time, thebackupfolder will likely contain a superset of shortcuts fromMy Shortcuts.Archive Allcreates a zip archive of the shortcuts inMy Shortcutsand saves the file to thearchivefolder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Archive/. The archive is named based on the date/time and #x(wherexis the number of shortcuts in the new zip archive). For example, the following archive would include102shortcuts: 2019-12-10-073522_#102.zip.Archive Selectedcreates a zip archive of one or moreselectedshortcuts inMy Shortcutsand saves the file to thearchivefolder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Archive/. The archive is named based on the date/time and either: a) #x(wherexis a number2tonindicating the number of contained shortcuts), or b)shortcutname(if onlyoneshortcut is selected). For example, the following archive would include102shortcuts: 2019-12-10-073522_#102.zip and the following would include one shortcut namedxyz: 2019-12-10-073522_xyz.zip.Restore(from a selected folder)displays a list ofspecifiedfolders that contain shortcut files. Once the user selects one of the folders, a second selection list is displayed with all of the shortcuts within the folder. If the user selects one or more of these shortcuts, they are restored toMy Shortcuts.By default, the folder list contains three folders in /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/:Any other folder in/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/can be added to the list by adding it to aList actionwithinBART. This could be useful for users that have used another means to backup and/or organize shortcut backup files.Note: All folder entries are case-sensitive!Restore(from a zip archive)displays a list of zip archives in thearchivefolder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Archive/. If a user selects one of the zip archives, the file isunzippedinto a new subfolder in theunarchivefolder: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Unarchive/. For example, if the user selected 2019-12-10-073522_#102.zip the archive would be unzipped into the following: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Unarchive/2019-12-10-073522_#102/. After the archive is unzipped, a second selection list is displayed with all of the shortcuts within the subfolder. If the user selects one or more shortcuts, they are restored toMy Shortcuts.Restore(from an unarchive folder)displays a list of subfolders in theunarchivefolder. If a user selects one of the subfolders, a second selection list is displayed with all of the shortcuts within the subfolder. If the user selects one or more shortcuts, they are restored toMy Shortcuts.This restoration operation would be used to recover a shortcut that was previously archived (usingArchive AllorArchive Selected) and then subsequently unzipped using theRestore(from a zip archive)operation.Restore One(from a file browse)will open a file selection dialog to allow the user to select a shortcut file. The selected shortcut will be restored toMy Shortcuts.This restoration operation would likely be used infrequently as it is intended for files that were backed up prior to usingBART. This method has the advantage of being more flexible in that the shortcut file can be located anywhere, not limited to/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/. The disadvantage of this method is that only one shortcut can be selected per file browse.Helpdisplays this information.By default, all files created byBARTare saved exactly as described in the above sections. This is appropriate if:Conversely in cases where multiple iOS devices are being used andiCloud Syncis not being used, it is recommended to segregate theBARTfiles. This change can be made whenBARTis first downloaded or at anytime later usingSettings->Customize Shortcut.Ifsegregationis selected, the BART root folder becomes: /iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/device_name. For example, if the device name isMy iPhone, the folders mentioned in the previous section would be subfolders of/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/:Shortcut files saved toiCloud DrivebyBARTinclude ashortcutextension (e.g., xyz.shortcut).TheShortcutsapp is an updated version ofWorkflow, a third-party iOS app that Apple acquired in 2017. Although similar, this app includedworkflows, notshortcuts. Workflow files included awflowextension and, like shortcut files, can be restored usingBART.With iOS 13.x, theShortcutsapp cannot restore/import a shortcut file directly fromiCloud Drive. (This limitation did not exist with the iOSWorkflowapp, but may have been added by Apple for security reasons.) Therefore to restore/import a shortcut, the shortcut file must first be uploaded to iCloud (in a public area established by Apple that is reserved for shortcuts). Once uploaded, a shortcut file can then be restored/imported within Safari by opening an iCloud link (to the uploaded shortcut file).BARTautomates the process described above. However once the link is opened in Safari, a user must complete the final step by selecting blueGet Shortcutbutton that appears on the shorcut's Safari page. Because of a limitation with theShortcutsapp, this final step cannot be completed if a shortcut is still running. Due to these constraints, only one shortcut can be automatically restored/importedfor each runofBART(or any similar restoration shortcut). Therefore if the user selects more than one shortcut to restore, the first one will be restored during that run ofBART; shortcuts 2 tonwill be queued up and ready to be restored, one at a time, with each subsequent run ofBART.As mentioned above,snapshot,backup, andarchivefiles are saved to/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/subfolders, specificallyBART/Snapshot/,BART/Backup/, andBART/Archive/, respectively. In addition,BART/Develop/houses copies of shortcuts that are modified using theDevelopoperation.In general, the contents of these folders are managed automatically byBART, but in some cases the contents can be managed manually using the iOSFilesapp or the macOSFinder. Specifically:Shortcuts no longer needed but previously backed up toBART/Backup/can be manually deleted.Shortcuts files (*.shortcut), and even old Workflow files (*.wflow), can be manually added toBART/Backup/. These shortcuts (or workflows) can be restored using theRestore(from a selected folder)operation.As an alternative to the above bullet, oldShortcutsapp (orWorkflowapp) backups could be managed in a separate folder(s) within/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/. Files in this folder(s) can be restored using :Unneeded zip archive files inBART/Archive/can be deleted when they are no longer needed.Unneeded copies of shortcuts inBART/Develop/can be deleted when they are no longer needed; however, older copies will beautomaticallypurged per theCopiesvalue when using the _Develop__ operation. SeeProtection While Developing or Modifying Other Shortcutsfor more information.)Older zip archives that includeshortcuts(or evenworkflows), that may have been created by some other means, can be manually added toBART/Archive/.BARTcould then be used to process these archives just as it does for the archives that it creates.Unarchive subfolders inBART/Unarchive/can be deleted (e.g., BART/Unarchive/2019-12-12-131131_#109). Also, shortcuts no longer needed can be individually deleted from these subfolders.Note: Shortcuts files can be copiedfromBART/Snapshot/, but since this folder is automatically managed byBART, the folder contents should not be modified.BARTcan be optionally started from another shortcut. This is also known as runningBARTinInputmode. This mode is useful because routine tasks can be automated and run consistently and quickly without user interaction with theBARTmain menu.Before continuing, download these simple, example shortcuts:Snapshpt ➤ BARTandArchive ALL ➤ BARTcan be used as is. For the other two,Duplicatethem to create a copy that can be modified for your use. For example, copyArchive ➤ BARTand name itArchive (My Stuff) ➤ BART. Then openArchive (My Stuff) ➤ BARTand continue reading.To runBARTin this mode, thecallingshortcut needs two actions:DictionaryandRun Shortcut.ThisDictionaryinformation is used byBARTto determine the desiredOperation(in lieu of user interaction with theBARTmain menu). Depending on theBART Operation, theDictionaryaction must haveoneortwoDictionary Items: [item 1:Key =Operation] or [item 1:Key =Operation;item 2:Key =Shortcut].The followingone-itemBARTOperationsare supported:And the followingtwo-itemBARTOperationsare also supported:As mentioned above, the aboveDictionaryaction must precede theRun Shortcutaction (specificallyRun[BART]).Note 1: In the second group ofBART Operations, a third key [Key =Shortcuts] can replace the second key [Key =Shortcut]. This must be employed whenbacking uporarchivingmore thanoneshortcut with a singleDictionary/Run[BART]pair. In this case, theDictionaryitemmust be anArray, with Key =Shortcuts, and theshortcut_namesare entered as separateTextarrayitems.Note 2: If theDictionaryincludesShortcut(Text Key for1shortcut_name) andShortcuts(Array Key for1 or moreshortcut_names), allshortcut nameswill be used byBART.The shortcuts mentioned in the previous section,Running BART From Another Shortcut, are great candidates for theShortcutsappAutomation, also known aspersonal automationin theShortcuts User Guide. As an example in the two following videos,Archive ➤ BARTis used to demonstrate how a full archive can be executed at 11:30/pm everyday.BARTInputmodeoperationsare discussed in a section above:Running BART From Another Shortcut.BARTincludes one additionaloperation:Develop. This operation, however, is unique in that it isnot availablewhen runningBARTinteractively.Developis used to save a copy of a shortcut to thedevelopfolder (/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/BART/Develop/) and then open the shortcut in theShortcutapp editor. Then, if needed (e.g., if a large block of actions is mistakenly deleted during the editing session), the saved copy can be restored usingBARTinteractively (usingRestore from selected folder).Before continuing, with the following shortcut, download,Duplicate, and open your copy:Note that this is an example that specifies three shortcuts:Brush Teeth Timer,Log Water,Tea Timer, selected in the example simply because they are available in theShortcutsappGallery. In theDictionaryaction:BARTcombines the single name inShortcutkey with the one or more names inShortcutskey. After the keys are combined, if the list contains more than one shortcut name,BARTwill generate aChoose from Listso that the shortcut of interest at that particular time can be selected. This is helpful if there is a set of shortcuts that are regularly opened in theShortcutsapp editor.If only one shortcut name is specified, thenBARTwill copy the shortcut and open it in the editor, i.e., theChoose from Listwill not appear.PRO Tip: One can specify commonly edited shortcuts in the __Shortcuts__ key. Then in a case where there will be many editing sessions with one shortcut, the __Shortcut__ key could be used and the __Shortcuts__ key could be renamed to __xShortcuts__. That way, the __Choose from List__ would be bypassed during the focused work on the single shortcut.TheCopieskey defines how many copies of a shortcut will be retained in thedevelopfolder. If this key is not specified, the default value (defined inBART) will be used. Older copies in excess of this setting will be automatically deleted from thedevelopfolder.TheNotifykey determines ifBARTwill generate a notification when the shortcut is copied. If this key is not specified,BARTwill use itsSuppress Notifications?Configuration Parameter to determine if a notification should be generated.With iOS 14.5, Apple introduced a new bug that generates an error when some shortcuts are written to the localiCloud Drive:An error occurred in the destination for the data.The data couldn't be written because of a error in the destination for the data.If this error is observed duringBARTbakups and archives, download and runIdentify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts. When all of the problematic shortcuts are identified, the names will be written to a file namedShortcuts • Error Saving.txt(folder:/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/
Identify iOS 14.5 Problematic Shortcuts/). Once this file is created,BARTwill use it and exclude the problematic shortcuts.Since entries inShortcuts • Error Saving.txtwill not be saved byBART, you might want to manually back up these shortcuts usingCopy iCloud Linkand saving the links (https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/shortcut ID) for use in the event it becomes necessary to restore one of the problematic shortcuts.If/when Apple addresses this bug,BARTwill be modified to ignoreShortcuts • Error Saving.txt.BART, Version 3.0, has been tested with the following:BARTis available exclusively atRoutineHub.co.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackUpdateHub was designed to keep all of your Shortcuts up to date without the requirement of running them individually.Graphics byMediaKit28-7-2019:Due to the changes made by Apple in the latest version of their operating system, any Shortcut created using iOS 13 (and iPadOS) will no longer be compatible with earlier versions such as iOS 12.Bulk Search is UpdateHub’s bread and butter, allowing you to check all of your Shortcuts for updates at once. This is achieved by parsing every Shortcut in your library and fetching the data stored in a”Comment Action”at the top. This is the only thing you’ll need to add in order for UpdateHub to fetch the latest updates from RoutineHub or a privately hosted json file.Manual Search is an optional method to manually check RoutineHub or a privately hosted json file for the latest update. This will only check the Shortcut you’re currently running and is lightning fast. This is achieved by a”Text Action”with the name of your Shortcut and the”Run Shortcut Action”linking to UpdateHub.Sometimes things break and us creators sometimes scramble trying to fix a broken update and publish a new version ASAP. To combat this issue, UpdateHub has support for rolling back an update. If there’s something wrong with a version currently accessible via RoutineHub and you delete it or you update your privately hosted json file, anybody who has already downloaded it will be notified to downgrade the next time they check for an update.Beta Updates are an optional feature for creators that applies the same simplicity towards beta version of their Shortcuts. This will finally allowing users an easily solution to finding and installing the latest (beta) versions of their favourite Shortcuts. This will work seamlessly alongside Bulk Search and will only require an extension to the required”Comment Action”at the top of your Shortcut.Build Numbers are an optional feature for creators that was designed to work perfectly alongside beta updates. This will allow you to maintain the version number of an upcoming release while still pushing updates to your beta testers. When you’re done with the version you can simply remove the build numbers and UpdateHub will recognise this is a new update, not a rollback.Localisation brings UpdateHub to your native language, which is all possible thanks to TranslateHub. If you have TranslateHub added to your Shortcuts the next time you run UpdateHub, it will be automatically translated to your preferred language of choice ad continue working as you would expect it to.Below you will find detailed instructions on how to implement UpdateHub into your Shortcuts. This includes options for hosting your updates on RoutineHub or privately hosting them. You will also find an extra (optional) step to manually check for an update through your Shortcut. This step can also be used to automatically check for updates every 24 hours, you can see an example of this in theDEMOprovided.Multi-decimal version numbers are supported all thanks to the brilliant mind UpdateKit, the first updater Shortcut for iOS. Mike Beasley recently updated his Shortcut to version 4.0, where he developed a script that will quickly compare two versions. UpdateKit Engine 1.1 is one of the most efficient ways to do this. UpdateHub may use a heavily modified version of the script, but without it multi-decimal version numbers wouldn’t be supported. To learn more about UpdateKit and UpdateKit Engine, you can follow the link provided below.Learn MoreAs you can see from the examples below, build numbers are created by adding”-TEXT-NUMBER”. You may replace the first part with any text you like or you can use“alpha”and“beta”which is recommended. The second part is your build number, simply start from 1 and work your way up until you’re ready to release the update to everybody, at which point you will remove all additional data and return the a standard version.Note:This feature currently requires an update from RoutineHub in order to work correctly.

Converted actions are put into the clipboard so that you can paste them into any shortcut.This shortcut helps you create complex dictionary actions in Shortcuts. You can write and test dictionaries in JSON-style text, e.g.{"name":"bong","happy":true}, and later use this tool to convert them to native actions, avoiding painful steps in building multi-level actions manually.Arrays, e.g.["hello", "world"], can also be converted to list actions. It can convert multiple objects, e.g.{} [2, 3] {"say":"hi"}, at once and accepts (text, json, pdf, etc) files or text selection through a share sheet or file picker, or copied text in the clipboard.“Dictionaries in text form are easier to read and edit. Why convert to native actions?”you may ask.Native actions look cool :) but are hard to navigate and edit. Sometimes you would like to have native actions instead of messy text actions when you share your works with others. With this tool, you can continue using text dictionaries throughout your developing and testing phases.Dictionaries in text form do not retain the order of the key/value pairs when run. This is a pain for JSON text when the order is important, for example, when usingChoose from List. This tool preserves the order.This tool converts numbers such as3.14,3,14or٣٫١٤into scientific notation314E-2that works for all regions.You can create dictionaries containing newline characters in keys or values.This tool is probably the only way to create lists with multiple-type items such as numbers, booleans and even dictionaries, e.g.["text", -2.3, false, {"a":"b"}].

- Description: Description1. Transfer one or more shortcuts from "My Shortcuts" to another shortcut.2. Transfer individual actions of a shortcut from "My Shortcuts" to another shortcut.3. Transfer actions that you have saved as snippets in your personal "MergeCuts Library" to another shortcut.The function of being able to transfer complete shortcuts to another shortcut is based on the basic idea of MergeCuts, which you got to know in the introduction.Transferring individual actions from one shortcut to another is an extension of MergeCuts that gives you even more flexibility.You can transfer snippets that are in your personal MergeCuts library just as easily as you have learned to transfer entire shortcuts.If you want to add an entire shortcut to your collection, it's easy with this.If you want to add actions of a shortcut to your library, you should prepare it with theMergeActionscomments, as you have already learned in "Merge".If you no longer need snippets from your library, you can easily remove them from your personal MergeCuts library.The MergeCuts preview feature offers you a visual view of your entries saved in the MergeCuts library.MergeCuts does not accept any liability for the loss of data caused by the use of the shortcut. Please make sure you have a backup and at best duplicate shortcuts before using them with MergeCuts.All graphics on this page were made with MediaKitLatest Release NotesFeedbackCreating shortcuts is a lot of fun. However, depending on the complexity of the task, a shortcut can easily contain hundreds or even thousands of actions. Often, shortcuts consist of several functions, each of which could be its own little shortcut.For quite some time now I have gotten into the habit of breaking down individual functions into their own little shortcuts so that I can test and edit them individually. Another advantage is that I don't have to scroll up and down to the position I'm working on, especially with very action-rich shortcuts. After all, with several hundreds of actions, one can quickly lose the overview. But what to do with, for example, five small shortcuts that should actually be part of a big one?The idea for MergeCuts was born. With MergeCuts you can (among other things) merge several shortcuts with another one. To do this, MergeCuts looks for a comment in the target shortcut with the content *MergeCuts*. Exactly at this point, the comment is replaced by the source shortcut(s). So you can easily create one shortcut out of several shortcuts.This concept is extended by an option to be able to transfer individual actions of a shortcut. This is done with the help of special comments in the source shortcut. You can find out exactly how this works here This feature extends the flexibility of MergeCuts and allows you to copy and paste actions easily.Another feature of MergeCuts is the creation of your personal library of shortcuts or actions that you use frequently (an updater, a special dictionary, menus, etc.) You can easily access these snippets at any time to include the actions in your shortcuts.Important:No matter which of the three options you choose, for all of them, applies: In order for MergeCuts to recognize where your shortcuts, actions, snippets should be transferred to the target shortcut, your target shortcut needs a comment action with the content *MergeCuts* (including the asterisks). The merge takes place by finally replacing this comment with the shortcuts, actions or snippets you selected before.And that's how it works:In the first step, decide how many shortcuts you want to transfer. The background of this action is to ensure the correct order in the target shortcut.For example, if you want to transfer two shortcuts named "KB-X" and "KB-Y" to shortcut "KB-Z" you type "2" in the first step.
Now all your shortcuts from "My Shortcuts" are displayed in a list. Select the shortcut to be copied first, in this example "KB-Y".The list opens again and you select the second shortcut—in this example "KB-X". With this you have determined the order:In the last step, you select "KB-Z", the target shortcut. If this shortcut contains the MergeCuts comment (*MergeCuts*), your three shortcuts will merge into one. You will be prompted to create the iCloud link, and then you can easily import the new shortcut.And that's how it works:If you want to transfer individual actions of a shortcut from "My Shortcuts" to another shortcut, you should first make some preparations.Not only does your target shortcut need a special comment, but also your source shortcut—but with the content *MergeActions* (including the asterisks)—and up to two comments of this kind. What for? You'll find out now:Open the shortcut that contains the actions you want to transfer to another shortcut. Now add a comment action containing *MergeActions* (including the asterisks) in front of the first action you want to copy. Add a second comment with the same content below the last action you want to copy.
Thus you have created a kind of frame around the actions you want to transfer to your target shortcut.Alternatively, you can just add a single *MergeActions* comment. However, this will cause all actions below the comment to be selected.If you do not add a single comment in the source shortcut, all actions of the shortcut are selected.These are the possible preparations you can or should make. Why is this recommended? Later you will be shown a list of all actions that are located between two comments or under a single comment. From this list, you can then transfer all actions or limit the selection further.Example:Your shortcut "KB-X" consists of 100 actions.Two comments:You want to copy the actions 25-50, so in "KB-X" put the first comment in position 24 and the second comment in position 51, then when you select shortcut "KB-X", the actions 25-50 will be displayed in a list. You can then decide whether you want to transfer all 25 actions to your target shortcut or only some of them.One comment:You want to copy the actions 75-100, so you put a comment in "KB-X" at position 74, and then when you select shortcut "KB-X", the actions 75-100 are shown in a list. You can then decide whether you want to transfer all 25 actions to your target shortcut or only some of them.No comment:If you have not inserted a comment with the content *MergeActions* in the shortcut "KB-X", the following happens: If you select "KB-X" in MergeCuts, all actions, i.e. 1-100, will be displayed in a list. You can then decide whether you want to transfer all 100 actions to your target shortcut or only some of them. But: It takes a relatively long time until this list is generated from 100 actions. That's why it is recommended to add the corresponding *MergeActions* comments before. This also has the advantage that you have the actions visually in front of you because the list of actions is only partially readable. If you want to transfer all actions of a shortcut anyway, use the option "Select Shortcuts", which is designed for this purpose.And that's how it works:Decide in the first step how many snippets you want to transfer. The reason for this action is to ensure the correct order in the target shortcut.For example, if you want to transfer two snippets named "SP-X" and "SP-Y" to shortcut "KB-Z" type "2" in the first step.Now all your snippets from your created library are displayed in a list. Select the snippet to be copied first, in this example "SP-Y".The list opens again and you select the second snippet—in this example "SP-X". With this you have determined the order:In the last step, you select "KB-Z", the target shortcut. If this shortcut contains the MergeCuts comment (*MergeCuts*), your two snippets will be merged with the shortcut "KB-Z". You will be prompted to create the iCloud link and then you can easily import the new shortcut.MergeCuts checks if one of your source shortcuts (snippets remain unaffected by this) uses the share sheet function. If this is the case, you have two options:Please note that you cannot transfer multiple shortcuts at the same time if one of them uses the share sheet function. If this is still the case and you tap onNo, MergeCuts will be closed automatically and you need to start over. Don't worry, everything will be explained to you in the shortcut when the case arrives.You will see all your shortcuts from "My Shortcuts" and you simply select the shortcut whose actions you want to save. The name of the shortcut is offered as a suggestion, but you can, of course, decide for yourself how you want to name the item.You will see all your shortcuts from "My Shortcuts" and you simply select the shortcut whose actions you want to save. Here you can also decide later if you want to save all or only some of your actions. You choose the name of the entry yourself.Shortcuts/Snippets that you save in your library always have a disabled share sheet function. So you have to activate it later in the final shortcut and reconnect/adjust the corresponding action(s)—which is no big deal.Your entries are displayed alphabetically. You can remove one or more snippets at once. Simply select the items you want to remove and then tap "Done". Your entries will be removed immediately. This step cannot be undone.Ideally, you should name your entries so that you can remember what actions are behind them. If this is not the case, you can view your actions in the same way you are used to when creating/editing shortcuts in the app.Your snippets are displayed in a list sorted alphabetically. Select the entry for which you want to generate the preview. This preview is generated live and requires you to create an iCloud link. A new window will open and the preview will be shown after a short time.Please note that the preview feature was actually designed for iOS 12 shortcuts. Therefore the appearance of the actions is the same as in iOS 12. iOS 13 shortcuts are still displayed as well. Some actions are unfortunately not supported, but a message will alert you in case of an error. The preview function is rudimentary but should serve its purpose. In the future, iOS 13 shortcuts will also be fully supported. Please be patient until then.Nice to know: The guide adapts to your display settings (Light or Dark Mode) as well as to the selected theme.MergeCuts uses a built-in update mechanism that automatically checks for updates on RoutineHub.co. Set here in days how often to search for an update. For example, if you decide for 3 days and use MergeCuts daily, it will only check for updates every three days. If you choose 0 days, MergeCuts will check for updates every time you run it. You do not have to worry about the speed of the shortcut. No matter which update check interval you choose, it will not significantly affect the speed of MergeCuts.This setting area is dedicated exclusively to the option of transferring individual actions of one shortcut to another. By default, all actions are selected initially. Since you would ideally prepare your shortcut with *MergeActions* comments anyway, there is no direct reason why the actions should not be selected initially. However, with this setting, you have the freedom to influence this behaviour.In order for you to select the source and destination shortcut, a list of your shortcuts from "My Shortcuts" is displayed. You can decide for yourself whether these shortcuts are to be displayed alphabetically (A-Z) or whether the order of the displayed shortcuts corresponds to the sort order you created in "My Shortcuts". Alternatively, you can also display everything in the order of the shortcut you last edited. The most recently edited shortcut is at the top.MergeCuts has a visual menu concept, which should simplify the navigation for you. You can choose between the Classic and the Emojified theme. The Classic theme also supports the display settings of iOS. This means that the theme adapts itself depending on whether you use the Light or Dark Mode. The MergeCuts Guide also adapts visually according to your choice.MergeCuts currently offers you three languages to choose from—English, German and French. During the setup process, you have already chosen a language initially. You can change this language setting here at any time.MergeCuts uses the ScPL Preview feature to generate previews for the snippets stored in the MergeCuts library. I have added a dark mode version. Thanks to the help of robric18 the feature of transferring actions could be significantly optimized! Thanks to elio27 for translating MergeCuts into French.To be honest, not a single thing happened during the entire development and testing phase. But you never know...MergeCutshas an integrated update mechanism calledEmbed-a-Update. Thanks to the embedded updater,MergeCutsdoes not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll always be up to date and never miss an update.This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co. If you find it somewhere else, it's a fake. Please let me know in the comments below if you found this Shortcut somewhere else. Thanks.1.2.1 - Sept. 11, 2020, 2:24 p.m.New in version 1.2.1: MergeCuts now speaks French. Amusez-vous bien !

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis tool is designed to be a helpful companion to any Minecraft iOS content creator! It contains useful things like downloading the vanilla behavior and resource packs from minecraft.net, fresh for customizing! There’s also plenty of links to helpful resources online, which are useful for new and longtime creators alike! It also includes sound effects from the game!Useful Features:Pack Manifest Compiler, which makes a .manifest file for you without coding knowledge!
• Seed Generator, which generates a random seed following the same rules as if it were in-game!
• Package Content section, which allows you to prepare Minecraft creations for publishing/sharing!
• Generate UUID, which grabs a fresh UUID from uuidgenerator.net for pack creation.
• JSON Validator window, which doesn’t require leaving the app!
• Text Stylizer, which takes a text input and adds extra style for in-game text boxes like world names, signs, and chat! • Nether Portal Calculator, which calculates the location your portal will end up in the Overworld or Nether based on coordinates.
• Mojang API features, like checking system status of the API. More coming in 2020.Extra Features:• Displays the latest Minecraft version in the main menu.
• Open com.mojang folder option; if you have the shortcut FS Bookmarks, you can grab the URL scheme to the folder and place it inside the shortcut for faster access. If you don’t have it, it just tells you how to locate the folder and opens the files app for you.
• Tutorials for essential Minecraft content creation inbuilt and available offline!
• More coming soon... •The Documents app isn’t required, but it’s recommended for some functions. I am working to make Minecraft Studio independent of it, but some sections still need it. I also suggest downloading MCPE Addons if you haven’t already, as it can download and install content for Minecraft without even leaving the app!Warning:This shortcut is massive, and it may cause your app to crash when updating if you don’t delete your older copy of Minecraft Studio first. Be patient as it imports, and I recommend not running it in the edit menu.2.3.1 - Jan. 20, 2020, 4:29 p.m.• Changed the Text Stylizer option to a dependency, reducing number of actions. A new vCard interface with some more dependencies instead of embedded shortcuts is already in the works for 3.0. Stay tuned.• Changed some glyphs and labels in the menus to better reflect what they do.• Consolidated app list options into one main menu item.• Minor big fixes.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackCopy and Paste a Shortcut is not compatible with iOS 15 and up due to changes in the App. Unfortunately there is no workaround to fix itThis Shortcut greatly improves your workflow by allowing you to copy and paste blocks of selected actions between shortcuts.What’s New in version 1.0?There are two methods of copying actions with Copy and Paste A Shortcut:Once you select a copy method, you will be asked to select:Due to the restrictions of the shortcuts app, when copying multiple actions between shortcuts, a new shortcut must be created, Copy And Paste A Shortcut will create that new shortcut after the final step above.You may copy an entire shortcut or just specific actions from the shortcut.If you want to copy the entire shortcut, you don't need to do any advanced preparation. However, if you want to specify particular actions from a shortcut to copy, you will need to do some quick preparation in the source shortcut before running this one.In order to specify which actions from a shortcut you want to copy, you need to open the shortcut and place a comment box with the text *** in it before the first action you want to copy and another comment with the text *** after the last action you want to copy (see image below).If you want to copy actions from multiple locations in your source shortcut, you can add *** comment pairs around each set of actions you want to copy.If you want to paste your copied actions in a specific place in your shortcut, you will need to specify the paste location in advance.To specify a paste location, before running this shortcut, open the shortcut you want to paste into and insert a comment box with the text +++ in it where you want the text pasted (like in the image below).If you don't specify a paste location, the copied actions will be pasted at the end of the specified shortcut.If you specify two paste locations, the actions will be pasted in both locations (but be aware, doing so may cause some shortcuts to not work properly).With a regular copy, once you finish selecting your copy/paste shortcuts, a new shortcut must be created with your copied actions.You will be given the opportunity to select whether to keep the same shortcut icon as one of your source shortcuts or select a new one for the new shortcut.If you choose to select a new icon, you will be asked to pick the color of the new icon.After selecting the new icon color, you will be given a list of glyph (icon) categories to pick the new icon from.Next you will pick a specific icon from the category. It may take a moment for these choices to appear as they are created dynamically on your device.Next you will be asked to confirm you like the new glyph (icon). If you aren't happy with it, you can change either the color or the glyph until you are happy with the selection.Next you will be given an opportunity to name your new shortcut. The paste shortcut name is pre-filled by default.In a quick copy, you are just asked which shortcut you want to copy from, if you want to create a new shortcut or if you want to paste and, if pasting, which shortcut you want to paste to.In quick copy, you aren't given the option to customize the icon glyph/color or shortcut name. Additionally, in quick copy, the shortcut will automatically presume that you want the copied text pasted at the end of the shortcut if you don't have a paste action and that you want to copy the entire shortcut if you don't have copy comments.Once the copy and paste actions have been completed, an alert will appear describing the final steps to you. Follow these steps to finish creating your shortcut with the copied actions.The link to your new shortcut is copied to your clipboard and opened in safari in the background in case there are any issues automatically opening the new shortcut in Shortcuts. Use that link if the new shortcut doesn't automatically load.1.1 - Jan. 16, 2021, 9:06 p.m.added hidden glyphs as shortcut icon optionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

I wouldn't recommend bundling the Base64 from the tutorial as it may be out of date.After running DependKit, a dictionary will be outputted containing the version of the installed DependKit. You can use this to require a certain version if your dependency requires a certain feature only available in newer versions of DependKit. You can even input an empty dictionary (still needs to have one field) to only get the ouput dictionary.made by@heyitzspencer1.6 - Nov. 16, 2018, 2:24 a.m.-Fixed the strangest bug cause by one “Get Variable” action at the end of the Shortcut...Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionThe Shortcuts app allows you to use vCard based menus. With such menus, you can give your shortcuts a personal touch and visually optimize the navigation. Many shortcuts have various settings, which the user can adjust according to his or her wishes. For these settings, there is often a choice between "On" and "Off". iOS Switches provides you with the appropriate graphics for this purpose.If you have no idea how to integrate a switch into a vCard menu so that it also changes its appearance when a setting is changed, then this shortcut is for you:iOS Switches SimpleIf you want to learn how to add support for Light and Dark Mode, this advanced example is for you:iOS Switches AdvancedAll graphics on this page were made with MediaKitLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut is mainly intended for shortcut developers. "iOS Switches" provides the switch graphics in Base64 format, already resized and prepared for your vCard menu. Start the shortcut, tap a switch of your choice and the graphic will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the copied code into your shortcut. That’s it.Tip: Change the mode by tapping "Switch to Dark/Light Mode" to display the respective switches. The colors in Dark Mode are correspondingly darker (and easier on the eyes) and not as bright and vibrant as in Light Mode. To get access to the On/Off Label Switches tap on "Switch to Label Switches".The ON switches are available in the original iOS colors blue and green. The OFF switch is available in light and dark gray to support shortcuts that use vCard menus with support for Light and Dark Mode. The ON switches are also available in all iOS 13 and iOS 14 Shortcuts colors. A further collection of ten vibrant colors completes the range. All switches are available in shades designed for Light Mode and a more eye-friendly version designed for Dark Mode. All switches are also available in a version with ON/OFF labels.The switches graphics included in this shortcut were created with Adobe Illustrator by myself and are subject to copyright. If you want to use the switches in your shortcut, please add a comment with the following content near the graphics:The switches used as menu items in this shortcut were created using the "iOS Switches" shortcut by @ROP. "iOS Switches" is available exclusively on RoutineHub: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4777iOS Switches has an integrated update mechanism calledEmbed-a-Update.

- Description: DescriptionBackups—a tiresome but nevertheless important topic. Even when it comes to your shortcuts.Saving shortcuts with 1Backup is done in three simple steps:Restoring your shortcuts is as simple as backing them up:You already learned about adding folders when you saved your shortcuts. Whenever you spontaneously create a folder to save a shortcut directly in it, you choose the way via the main menu and the menu item "Backup". But if you want to create several folders at once, then you've come to the right place:If you have mistyped or just want to make changes to your folder name, you can do so here:If you accidentally saved a shortcut in the wrong folder or found a better place for it, just move it to another folder:There are moments when you might want to part with old shortcuts. If they are all in one folder, you can easily delete them:It doesn't always have to be whole folders—sometimes you just want to delete single shortcuts. Here's how it works:There are not many reasons to take this step, but if the time is right, you can reset your backup completely with this.You can view all your folders and shortcuts secured with 1Backup in the "Restore" area. But why wander far away, when the good is so close. With 1Backup Overview you can not only keep an eye on everything but also restore individual shortcuts.Almost all graphics on this page were made with MediaKitLatest Release NotesFeedbackThere are now a whole bunch of backup shortcuts, as everyone has a different idea of the perfect backup solution. These solutions may be ideal for one or the other, I myself follow my own way of backing up my shortcuts. And exactly this way I want to share with you with 1Backup.The concept:1Backup backs up your shortcuts in only one single file in iCloud Drive (as JSON dictionary). Additional security is provided by an automatic second backup with 1Backup for Dropbox (optional).It's basically the same as the backups you create for a computer—you should always make at least two identical backups on two different volumes in two different locations. And that's what 1Backup does.With 1Backup you can backup and restore several shortcuts at once. For a better overview, you can create folders to organize your shortcuts collection. Furthermore, there are numerous options that leave (almost) nothing to be desired: You can create multiple folders, edit folder names, move shortcuts from one folder to another. Shortcuts and folders can be deleted, and of course, it is also possible to reset the backup.The unique 1Backup Overview screen gives you a visual overview of all your folders and backed up shortcuts. In this area, you also have the possibility to restore individual shortcuts (although this is not the main purpose of 1Backup Overview).The only thing that requires 1Backup: Backup the shortcuts you work on regularly! You've been working on your shortcut for half an hour? Then save the shortcut! You take a short break? Then save the shortcut! You postpone working until tomorrow? Then save the shortcut!Good to know:1Backup uses an embedded update mechanism. The shortcut automatically and independently checks with each call whether updates are available or not. You can specify the frequency/interval in days in which 1Backup checks for updates. For example, if you use the shortcut daily, it may be enough for the shortcut to check for an update only every three days. This is up to you. You configure this after you have imported the shortcut.Nice to have:1Backup is equipped with a visual menu concept that makes navigation easier for you. The shortcut reacts to your display settings. Depending on whether you use Light or Dark Mode, the shortcut adapts accordingly. For those who like it a bit more playful, there is 1Backup Emojified (see images at the bottom of this page), which you can activate via the Import Questions.Important note:1Backup has many security measures to avoid errors—including those that could be caused by the user—and has been intensively tested. 1Backup is not responsible for the loss of backups or shortcuts. No need to worry, this should not happen.A lot of things have been improved since initial release, so some parts of the video are already outdated.Important:Since iOS 13 shortcuts can only be imported via the iCloud URL, shortcuts files can no longer be opened directly. Therefore, you have to create links (see image below) for the shortcuts you want to save. This is done immediately during backup in step 3. Don't worry, if you want to save several shortcuts at once, you still only need to confirm the creation of the links once.A good backup shortcut should not only give you the ability to back up and restore your shortcuts. With 1Backup Manage you can create multiple folders, edit folder names, move shortcuts from one folder to another, delete entire folders or just single shortcuts.1. Add Folders2. Rename Folders3. Move Shortcuts4. Remove Folders5. Remove Shortcuts6. Reset AllLike this:Folder OneFolder TwoFolder Three1Backup has an integrated update mechanism calledEmbed-a-Update. Thanks to the embedded updater, 1Backup does not require any external updater shortcut. The shortcut checks for updates itself, so you'll always be up to date and never miss an update.This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co. If you find it somewhere else, it's a fake. Please let me know in the comments below if you found this Shortcut somewhere else. Thanks.1.5 - Nov. 18, 2020, 6:55 p.m.Changelog for Version 1.5:— iOS 14 compatibility— Note: If you have previously used 1Backup with iOS 13 and used the Overview function as "embedded", please switch to "external" (Go to: Manage > Settings > Overview), as this option is currently not supported due to an iOS 14 bug.

Instead of requiring users download an extra shortcut to update yours, embed-a-update is embedded directly into your shortcut.There are so many different updaters, all requiring people to download a different shortcut just to check for updates. Why not have an updater that doesn't require any downloads?Embed-a-Update is an updater that gets embedded inside your shortcut. When people run your shortcut, even if it's the only shortcut they have installed, it just works.Embed-a-update only takes 40 actions to use in your shortcut. This shortcut can be used to automatically add those actions.Add an action to your shortcutRun Embed-a-Update and choose your shortcut.Your shortcut now has Embed-a-update embedded in it. It is helpfully surrounded with a repeat action to make moving and removing it easier.Make a copy of your shortcut before running embed-a-update on it. While it shouldn't cause any problems, there is always a chance when editing .shortcut files that it could not work properly and damage your shortcut.Make sure to remove any previous Embed-a-Update related actions if you had any before running Embed-a-Update on your shortcut. Because Embed-a-Update hardcodes unique IDs, running twice might cause shortcuts to use the same ID twice.You can customize anything you want in Embed-a-Update. Show errors when the shortcut fails to update, force all users to update instead of giving a choice. You are not required to keep the [Eᴍʙᴇᴅ-ᴀ-Uᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ] label, feel free to remove it if you wish.1.1.2 - Oct. 13, 2019, 6:43 p.m.New in version 1.1.2:- Switch Github urlLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackBundleKit was created as a utility to bring multiple shortcuts together into a single installer. Developers often use additional Shortcuts to run side tasks, perform actions (like updates or encryption), and simplify large Shortcuts that would be too difficult to manage on iOS inside the single edit screen.However, to keep users from having to download 2, 3, 4, 5 or more Shortcuts manually, @medicalshortcuts created BundleKit which will take multiple Shortcuts in your library and create a an installer that can be distributed to end users. When users download this installer, it will act like any installation process on a computer. Simply launch it from the Library and the shortcut will do the rest. You can then delete the installation Shortcut once completed so it doesn't clog up the user's library.Honestly, it's a personal choice, and if you don't want to use it then my feelings won't be hurt. That said, I created this Shortcut after working on a project that I developed a number of complex (or at least laborious) shortcuts that all ran in tandem but needed to be separated as they amounted to hundreds of line of actions in Shortcuts, and it was simply unmanageable on my iOS device. My solution was to individually encode each Shortcut component into an installer that could then be shared with the end user. However, this had many issues including that it made it nearly impossible to push updates for each of these and if I did, then I had to manually encode and decode each Shortcut every time.With BundleKit, you can now nearly automate this task and users can then download the most up to date installer, which contains your most up to date items. Additionally, if you want to push current updates to users, you can do so through shortcuts like UpdateKit on your own servers or on RoutineHub. This way current users stay up to date, but new users can download all of components needed with one installer.Right now? Not a whole lot. Though there are some fun things hidden if you happen to find them!It is suggested that you backup your shortcuts prior to using BundleKit. You should be doing this anyways!Here are some handy backup tools on RoutineHub!Each of your shortcuts that you want to be able to update later should include the required components to individually update (through UpdateKit, Check For Updates, or your other favorite update checker). After you push an update through the individual shortcut, simply re-bundle your shortcuts and re-upload your new installer for new users to download.BKInstaller is the utility that BundleKit uses to install your bundled Shortcuts to users. BKInstaller is created each time you run BundleKit and should be removed or renamed after BundleKit is completed.A credit is included in the base version of BUndleKit and can be left to credit BundleKit, you may also include text such as what is below in your final shortcuts if you wish:This Shortcut was installed and bundled with BundleKit by @medicalshortcuts on RoutineHub. More information: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/830BundleKit supports in-Shortcut support via email. Simply click Credits/Information/Support from the first menu and then “Report an issue with BundleKit” to send an email.* If you run either Shortcut from within the edit window, what will occur is that when it installs the first Shortcut it will open that Shortcut... The result will be that it stops the process. For some reason this does not occur when you launch from the Library icon, so this is the current "fix".Myself and @HeyItzSpencerreleased similar Shortcuts but that attack this issue in similar manners. As a result, we teamed up to make sure you get the Shortcut you need!

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackA video demonstration of this shortcut is availablehere(reddit, /shortcuts).This shortcut,SF Symbol for vCard Menuuses theCreate Iconaction included inToolbox Pro. This action requires theToolbox Pro Premiumin-app purchase.Toolbox Prois an amazing utility for theShortcutsapp. If you develop shortcuts, do yourself a big favor and install it today. You'll be amazed how it extends the capability of your shortcuts. Many of the additional actions it provides are free, but as mentioned above some require an in-app purchase.The purpose of this shortcut is to generate encoded photos suitable for shortcut vCard menus. All photos are based off one of the 1500+Apple SF Symbolsthanks to theToolbox ProCreate Iconaction.To create a vCard menu, the encoded photo that this shortcut generates can be pasted into the location indicated below (in aTextaction).Since the encoded photo is a very long string of text characters, it is more partical to paste the text into aDictionaryactionTextvalue and then reference that dictionary value inTextaction. See below for an example.If you are going to create a shortcut only for yourself and you have made theToolbox Pro Premiumpurchase to activate the premium actions (IMHOwell worththe nominal cost), theCreate Menuaction would be the quickest and easiest way to createvCard-stylemenus. In fact, it appears that theToolbox Proauthor,Alex Hay, is planning to add someadditional menu features.However, if you plan to create and share a shortcut and you can't be certain that the users will have purchasedToolbox Pro Premium, then the approach discussed in the previous section should be used. This is whenSF Symbol for vCard Menubecomes useful.The operation ofSF Symbol for vCard Menuis simple:After exitingSF Symbol for vCard Menu, the value in the clipboard can be pasted into a shortcut that includes a vCard menu. Below is such a shortcut namedvCard Menu Example.As mentioned above,SF Symbol namescan be typed after selecting[Type any SF Symbol name]. However, if there are certainSF Symbolsthat you use often that are not included on theSF Symbol Menu, you can add them by modifying aDictionaryaction that appears near the top of this shortcut. Just be aware, however, that if you reinstall or updateSF Symbol namesyou will loose those additions and need to add them back after the install/update.WhenSF Symbol for vCard Menuis opened it renders a menu that gives you quick access to this help and links toAppleand3rd partySF Symbolsinformation.SF Symbol for vCard Menu, has been tested with the following:SF Symbol for vCard Menuis available exclusively atRoutineHub.co. Versions obtained elsewhere might be out-of-date.The framed screenshots were created using the shortcutApple Frames (iOS)from theMacStories Shortcuts Archive.SF Symbol for vCard Menuchecks for updates of itself every 7 days usingEmbed-a-Update(Version: 1.1.2, Updated: 10/13/19).2.2 - April 6, 2021, 11:45 p.m.Bug fix: Selection pages are now advancing properly.

It has two features:It provides common functionality to the following shortcuts (and reduces the need to re-enter SSH info in each shortcut on every update):It creates signed shortcuts remotely for iPhone/iPad. Please note that it’s in beta, and the service may be down sometimes for hours or Apple may block it for security reasons. Signed shortcuts will have theStop This Shortcutaction at the beginning to prevent malicious intentions.iOS 15 cannot sign shortcuts programmatically. However, if you have a Mac running macOS 12, this shortcut can send an unsigned shortcut and receive a signed one using SSH. To set up SSH, please follow these steps:You need to do this when downloading an update of this shortcut or changing your device. For security, doNOTshare this shortcut with others because your SSH info can also be shared.Thanks tou/zachary7829for the SSH idea.Because of the way the iOS/macOS file system handles file names, newly signed shortcuts with accents or diacritics in their names will have a different internal representation (technically, NFD as opposed to the default NFC;https://​unicode.org/​reports/​tr15/) while they look the same visually as the originals. For example, éU+00E9in shortcut names will become eU+0065+ ́U+0301after signing. This results in multiple shortcuts with seemingly same names.To avoid the confusion,Shortcut Source Helperwill deliberately decompose such characters (e.g., ‘ợ곰’ becomes ‘o ̛ ̣ᄀ‍ᅩ‍ᆷ’). This will affect shortcut names in many European languages as well as Korean, Vietnamese, etc. Please rename them after signing.1.3.1 - Oct. 17, 2023, 10:49 a.m.2023-10-17• Updated workaround for iOS 17 data url bugLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackHawkUpdater was built for functionality, but it looks great, too. It works with only about 150 actions. For perspective, the average Updater uses 300-400 actions.
This is because HawkUpdater uses the latest technologies such as JavaScript engines, hidden features, and more.It also contains clear and distinct UIs, utilizing Unicode bolded text and italics and vCards.Like most modern updaters, HawkUpdater is extremely easy to integrate.That’s it! To check for updates to HawkUpdater, just run it on it’s own.
For a detailed integration guide, see the Handbook.Note: HawkUpdater 0.08 and lower can only handle single decimal version numbers. Starting with 1.0.0, HawkUpdater can function with multiple decimals. The transition between beta and 1.0.0 can break things, so back up your Shortcuts if you are still running 0.08.“That’s all well and good, but what canmyclients expect?”This is the core of HawkUpdater. Depending on how you integrate HawkUpdater, whenever you publish a shortcut update to routinehub, your users will be notified of it. An alert will appear with details like the version number, update notes, and more. Your clients can then eitherinstallthe update, orignoreit.As of beta 0.08, HawkUpdater also notifies of rollbacks, so you can be sure that your clients will only get the most stable updates and features.However, HawkUpdater is not only one of the most useful Updaters, but is also one of the moststylish. HawkUpdater offers things other updaters don’t have: themes. Utilizing vCard menus, HawkUpdater allows you and your users to customize the look of HawkUpdater however you want!As of 1/15/2021, HawkUpdater is no longer in beta. Keep the feedback coming, though!I’ll be adding quite a bit of features soon. These includeHave a suggestion? Need help? Found a bug?

However, if you have a Mac but it can’t run Monterey, or if you have a iOS 12/13/14 device, you can send the iOS 15 shortcut/wflow plist file to either the iOS 12/13/14 device or to the Mac that is running a Xcode simulator for iOS 13 or 14. From there, make a shortcut where you select the shortcut plist file (make sure it ends with .shortcut!), and use the Get Link to File action to share it to iCloud. From then on, you can use the iCloud API and fetch the signed shortcut file from it.1.2.1 - Nov. 14, 2022, 10:07 p.m.Added on-device support for iOS 15.0b1 and jailbroken devices with my Unsigncuts tweak, now available on Havoc.

- Description: DescriptionBase 64 encodedTextLatest Release NotesFeedbackAdd, remove, manage and keep dictionaries for including in your Shortcut.When finished adding pictures, video, audio files/text Asset Builder shares a json/dictionary that you paste into a text box in your Shortcut. You then use the assets anywhere in your Shortcut with a dictionary variable. Adding assets individually to a dictionary action can be fiddly, whereas pasting them all at once into a text box is easier.
If you need to edit you assets, you can just copy them out of the box, and then paste them back in.
If shortcuts is being buggy you can just add a copy to clipboard action, to get out, and sometimes it’s just easier to copy the assets into a new text box than to delete the old set inside the text box.You can just share back to Asset Builder if you need to add/delete or copy assets.You can easily reuse your dictionaries in other Shortcuts

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackHow to use ListifyIn your shortcut, get the images that you want to use for your list icons, and use theSet Nameaction on each in the following format{Set Name}This text becomes list item Title[text in brackets becomes Subtitle]Once you have a collection of images that include a Title and/or Subtitle in their names, use aRun Shortcutaction and select Listify. The images will be sent to Listify which will format them into a pretty list and return the list to your shortcut. Then simply place aChoose from Listaction below the call to Listify and you’re done.If you would prefer to not have the border that Listify overlays on your images, simply include the word(noframe)in parenthesis at the end of the image’s Set Name.At the bottom of this page you can download an Example Shortcut which will demonstrate Listify in action.How it WorksI was frustrated with Shortcut's inability to create Choose from List menus that could contain images as well as information, and discovered (at least for myself) a clever way of getting around the limitation.Previously, I'd found that if I passed a dictionary to a Choose from List, I could get aTitletext and aSubtitletext by reading the dictionary's Key for the top line, and Value for the second line. This is great but doesn't give me images.One solution I'd seen was to create a list that included both images as well as some other type of item like a Text item, and using the Set Name action on the images which would then show next to the image as a Title. The downside of this is that these lists always include the word "Image" below the Title, and the secondary item required in those lists would say "Text". Not pretty.Eventually I discovered that one type of list item that would give me all I wanted was a list ofContacts. vCards can contain an image file, and the person's Name would show up on one line, and their Company if specified would show up underneath.I opened up a vCard in a text editor, found them to be quite simple to create from blank text that specifies a "person's" Name, Company and Photo (in base64), and voila, I could now generate Contacts on the fly, pass them into a Choose from List action, and then read whatever information I wanted from the chosen item for the rest of my workflow.I used this method for my list-heavy bill management shortcut₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪-Demo, so feel free to check that out if you'd like.I've also created a simpleExample Shortcutwhich you can download alongside Listify. With it, you can specify some images (preferably square), and get back a pretty list from Listify. You can even use animated Gif images to have animated icons!Let me know if you have any questions down below or onReddit.1.01 - Nov. 29, 2018, 8:29 a.m.Implemented fix from u/NikoUY to allow Titles to now include Square Brackets.Only the last set of text within [square brackets] in a passed-item’s Name will be considered the Subtitle.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis is a Shortcut for helping people display large amounts of data using DataTables. It doesn't do anything practical, its a starting point for creating you're own easy to use tables for viewing on mobile devices.This version will take csv and show as a table, please note it only deals with very simple csv, there's no dealing with escaped characters, or different flavours of csv at all. The csv is in as a Text Action at the top of the Shortcut. I have no idea if it will work with excel csv etc, I'm not trying to build a csv conversion tool that works for every use case, just give people a tool to build something useful to them.
ie name,address,tel will work"name","address","tel" wont workDataTables is used to show tables in a way that works better for mobile, with pagination, search, responsive tables and will bunch data with expand/collapse to make it easier to work with on mobiles.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis Shortcut allows you to save actions and import them into a Shortcut, useful for things you use constantly or stuff you would like to save without needing to have a Shortcut dedicated to it.Tl;dr watch thisvideoto save a snippet.To save a snippet you need to open the Shortcut where the actions you want to save are located, put an empty comment above the actions you want to save and another one at the end (if you want to skip a section you can put a empty comment before it and you can start a new section using empty comments at a later time). After that you need to open this Shortcut and select Save Snippet, select the Shortcut where the actions are located and input the name of the Snippet.Tl;dr watch thisvideoto load a snippet.To load a snippet you need to open the Shortcut where you want to import the snippet to, put a comment that starts with “Snippet” and a small description to identify it (can be a number or whatever you want) at the location you want to import it, you can do this multiple times if you want to import more than one snippet, then open this Shortcut, select Load Snippet, select the Shortcut and after that it’ll scan the Shortcut for the comments that start with “Snippet” and ask you which of the saved snippets you want to replace it with.You can also Rename and Remove snippets from the list of saved snippets.The snippets support tags, if you put something between double curly brackets (for example {{Like This}}) when you load a snippet it’ll ask you for something to replace it with.1.0.1 - Dec. 11, 2018, 2:59 p.m.Forgot to change the ID of the Shortcut.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

This shortcut uses JavaScript’s native JSON.stringify() function to convert dictionaries into legible plain text.This shortcut can be run on its own, in which case it will prompt you to enter the JSON to pretty print, or it can be run from the share sheet for text or files containing JSON. It presents the beautified JSON in Quick Look and then asks whether you would like to copy the beautified JSON to the clipboard.This was inspired by the“JSON Validator and Beautifier” Instant Answerdeveloped by the DuckDuckHack community for DuckDuckGo.Thank you to@gluebytefor providingvaluable insightinto the quirks of Shortcuts, particularly the nature of Get File Of Type and the way Shortcuts handles dictionaries!1.3 - May 26, 2020, 4:22 p.m.Removes “Get File Of Type” to speed up execution and avoid localization bugs (where “public.rtf” is translated by default and breaks the action).Changes the URL to use the input JSON directly instead of the “Get Dictionary From Input” action’s output, to preserve the order of the keys.Thank you to @gluebyte for pointing out these issues!

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackGit is great for development, but the .pref files are binary and not readable on GitHub, so this shortcut converts them to a readable .xml file format before committing them so that you can see and read the changes more readily.With Private Repositories being free now on GItHub I think this is a great way to keep your shortcuts safe.I am actually pretty new to both Git and Working Copy. So, this is just a start.Ideas for further enhancement:
- Add option to pull in previous version from the git repository automatically (converting it back to .plist and restoring it in the Shortcuts app)
- Add a seperate commit messages per shortcut.0.2 - Jan. 8, 2019, 3:06 a.m.Fixed the UpdateKit integration to run every time, rather than my custom way.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionDefault settingsQuick modeLatest Release NotesFeedbackSince iOS 14 it is possible to copy and paste actions directly in the Shortcuts app, but it only works with single actions. This shortcut can copy any amount of actions anywhere. It even saves them so you can paste them later again.This shortcut is the successor of myCopyPaste Actionsworkflow back in the days when Shortcuts was calledWorkflow.It should also work with iOS 13.Quick mode enables you to preselect any number of shortcuts that should be loaded and processed when you run this shortcut. There are multiple settings to control the level of quick mode.Because it is so quick, you actually have to confirm it, otherwise there would be no way to turn it off again.I'm not responsible and cannot be held liable for any loss or damage in any way that results from the use or misuse of this shortcut. There may be bugs in it.I value your privacy. I do not and don't want to collect any information about you. The update check is the only information that is fetched from the internet. In this process, GitHub might be collecting some anonymous data which the browser automatically provides to any webserver. I can't change that. Otherwise, no data is sent anywhere.If you want to check for yourself, feel free to scroll through the shortcut and check out the JavaScriptsource code on GitHub(that is a lot!).If you want to contribute to this shortcut, then please do so!The preferred way is onGitHub, but you can also use the comments here, onReddit, or onAutomators Talk.Icons and images in the shortcut are either from Shortcuts itself, created by me or from Bootstrap.2.3.0 - May 29, 2021, 8:48 p.m.* add option to "Cleanup of functions" to remove the functions only when other actions are added or removed.* fix again a crash when refreshing the icon cache (hopefully, pelase let me know!)* fix a mysterious bug that saved the snippets file in the wrong format resulting in blank pages in SafariThanks to reddit.com/u/Dastefster for suggesting/helping fix these things!* fix "gzip decompression failed" error in Shortcuts.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackRunList and Dictionary Helperfrom your shortcut to modify a list or dictionary. It allows you to add, replace or remove an item usingdot notation.To delete an item from a list, pass a dictionary containingindexandlistto the shortcut. For example, to remove the second item from myList, pass{"index":2, "list":myList}. Use twoSet Dictionary Valueactions to create the dictionary; setindexfirst, followed bylistas shown in the image below. The shortcut returns a modified list.To insert an item, pass a dictionary ofindex,valueandlist. Setindexfirst thenvalueandlist. You can use a negative index to refer to an item from the end of the list. -1 is the last item, -2 is the second to last, etc. For example, to insert text "Zillion" between "Two" and "Three", you can pass{"index":-2, "value":"Zillion", "list":myList}as shown in the image. Zero index will append the value at the end.To replace an item, first remove it and then insert the new value to the same index.To delete an item from a dictionary, pass a dictionary ofkeyanddictionary. For example, to remove thetypevalue from the secondphonesdata, pass{"key":"phones.2.type", "dictionary":myDict}as shown in the image. Make sure that the type of myDict is Dictionary.To add or replace an item, pass a dictionary ofkey,valueanddictionary. For both lists and dictionaries, the value can be of any type; text, number, boolean, dictionary or list.If a key contains a dot in its name, enclose it in double quotes (e.g.,chapter."1.2".author).indexandkeyare interchangeable. That is, you can usekeyon a list and vice versa. Likewise,listanddictionarykeys are interchangeable.If you try to insert a value to a non-list item, the item will become a list and the new value will be inserted. For example, passingkeyorindexanimals.1andvalue"cat" to{"animals":"dog"}will return{"animals":["cat","dog"]}. This is similar to howAdd to Variableworks.You can use dot notation on a list to modify a dictionary inside. For example, passing2.catasindexorkeyto["hi",{"cat":"Tom","mouse":"Jerry"}, 42]will return["hi",{"mouse":"Jerry"}, 42].Also check outDictionary Action Builder, another neat utility for shortcut developers.2.0 - Aug. 26, 2020, 12:40 p.m.• Name changed from Dictionary Helper• Completely rewritten to support lists, negative indices, etc.• Automatic RoutineHub update check. Since this shortcut is supposed to be run by other shortcuts frequently and quickly, it checks for an update less frequently, at most once every two days.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackA video demonstration of this shortcut is availablehere(reddit, /shortcuts).The purpose of this shortcut is to provide information about AppleSF Symbols. More information can be found at theApple Human Interface GuidelinesPlease note: If you have theToolbox Pro iOS appinstalled and you have paid for thePremiumin-app purchase,SF Symbols Utilitywill include graphic previews of the AppleSF Symbols(shown below).Using the first menu item,Symbol Details, you can select any of the 1672 AppleSF Symbolsand view theCategory,Restrictions(if applicable; more about that below), and symbolImage.UsingSymbol by Categoryyou can select any of the 19Categories(or UNCATAGORIZED) and then view theSF Symbolsin that category. Any of the symbols in that category can be selected, or you can search from a subset by typing a portion of a symbol name.In the example below, a restricted symbol was selected, thus the pertinent information was returned, including a link to theApple Human Interface Guidelines. Note that Apple refers to these asSymbols for Use As-Is.Note also that the selected symbol is in twoCategories. MostSF Symbolsare in one, but s few are in two and several are UNCATEGORIZED. This group can also be browsed using theSymbol by Categorymenu option. UNCATEGORIZED appears at the end of the list.UsingRestrictionsyou can see a view of all 58Symbols for Use As-Is.UsingImage Filesyou can generate a small image file (approximately 4K) for each of theSF Symbols. These files are saved to iCloud and placed in subfolders based on category(ies). UsingiOS FilesormacOS Finder, you can get a nice preview of theSF Symbols.The primary data used by this shortcut can be viewed using theSymbols Dictionarymenu option. This information could be used in other shortcuts that employsSF Symbols. For an example, seeSF Symbol for vCard Menu.Note that the bulk of this dictionary information was obtained using the powerfulGet Symbol Nameaction included inToolbox ProPremium. That data was combined withSymbols for Use As-Isinformation from theApple Human Interface Guidelinesand organized using another shortcut that generated the dictionary displayed here. Since that shortcut is likely not useful to others, I've not published it on RoutineHub. But for those that might be interested,here it is.SF Symbols Utility, has been tested with the following:As mentioned above, the full-features of this shortcut requireToolbox Proand itsPremium In-App Purchase. Although some of the features of this shortcut are available without Toolbox Pro, development of the shortcutwould have been impossible without it.SF Symbols Utilityis available exclusively atRoutineHub.co. Versions obtained elsewhere might be out-of-date.The framed screenshots were created using the shortcutApple Frames (iOS)from theMacStories Shortcuts Archive.SF Symbols Utilitychecks for updates of itself every 7 days usingEmbed-a-Update(Version: 1.1.2, Updated: 10/13/19).2.0 - March 31, 2021, 8:59 p.m.Updated for iOS 14.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackUpdateHub was designed to keep all of your Shortcuts up to date without the requirement of running them individually.Graphics byMediaKit28-7-2019:Due to the changes made by Apple in the latest version of their operating system, any Shortcut created using iOS 13 (and iPadOS) will no longer be compatible with earlier versions such as iOS 12.Bulk Search is UpdateHub’s bread and butter, allowing you to check all of your Shortcuts for updates at once. This is achieved by parsing every Shortcut in your library and fetching the data stored in a”Comment Action”at the top. This is the only thing you’ll need to add in order for UpdateHub to fetch the latest updates from RoutineHub or a privately hosted json file.Manual Search is an optional method to manually check RoutineHub or a privately hosted json file for the latest update. This will only check the Shortcut you’re currently running and is lightning fast. This is achieved by a”Text Action”with the name of your Shortcut and the”Run Shortcut Action”linking to UpdateHub.Sometimes things break and us creators sometimes scramble trying to fix a broken update and publish a new version ASAP. To combat this issue, UpdateHub has support for rolling back an update. If there’s something wrong with a version currently accessible via RoutineHub and you delete it or you update your privately hosted json file, anybody who has already downloaded it will be notified to downgrade the next time they check for an update.Below you will find detailed instructions on how to implement UpdateHub into your Shortcuts. This includes options for hosting your updates on RoutineHub or privately hosting them. You will also find an extra (optional) step to manually check for an update through your Shortcut. This step can also be used to automatically check for updates every 24 hours, you can see an example of this in theDEMOprovided.Multi-decimal version numbers are supported all thanks to the brilliant mind behind one of the more popular Shortcuts for iOS, UpdateKit. Mike Beasley recently updated his Shortcut to version 4.0, where he developed a script that will quickly compare two versions. Not only is UpdateKit Engine 1.1 most efficient way to do this, but it also supports multi-decimal version numbers. To learn more about UpdateKit and UpdateKit Engine, you can follow the link provided below.Learn MoreAdding UpdateHub’s Bulk Search to your Shortcuts is quite possibly the easiest thing you’ll ever do. All UpdateHub requires from you to implement Bulk Search is a”Comment Action”at the top of your Shortcut.Due to the way UpdateHub fetches data from this comment, you may add some information about your Shortcut above the required text. Please keep this comment to a maximum of 12 lines in total to ensure UpdateHub can still find the data.To check for the latest updates using RoutineHub, you can reference the image below.To check for the latest updates using a privately hosted JSON file, you can reference the image below.To ensure your privately hosted JSON file is in the correct format, I recommend usingTHISShortcut to create it.To add a manual search to your Shortcut, use aText Actioncontaining the name of your Shortcut then add theRun Shortcut Actionlinking to UpdateHub.When you check updates manually through your Shortcut, you’ll finish with 3 types of response codes.When no updates are found, you’ll be returned with “NO-UPDATE”. In addition to this, UpdateHub will also send a notification to the user to inform them that they’re up to date.If an update has been found and the user has chosen to install it, you’ll be returned with “UPDATE”. I highly recommend adding anExit Shortcut Actionif you are returned this code.If an update has been found and the user has chosen to skip it, you’ll be returned with “SKIP-UPDATE”.If there was a problem parsing data from the requiredComment Action, you’ll be returned with “ERROR”.Note:If you’d like to see this in action, you can download a demo that will check for an update automatically every 24 hoursHEREIf you feel UpdateHub is the right fit for you and your Shortcuts, you may use the following on your RoutineHub page.[![UpdateHub](https://i.imgur.com/8tugTDE.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2066)If you experience any issues or require assistance with this shortcut, please contact me via Reddit and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.1.0.1 - July 18, 2019, 11:51 p.m.- Implemented a small notification and a download link for users running iOS 13.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

Where the comment says to make your facade mode code, either code a new version of the shortcut that looks real but is not, or change a variable that changes everything else up. (such as changing the directory it uses for file saving, that kinda thing.) If you go with the latter, remember to remove the ‘exit shortcut’ action, as your code will continue, (though with minor alterations.)This contains an optional security feature.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackConvert images into Base64 Data-URIs for embedding as image URLs directly into HTML or CSS. Powered usingEZGIF.com“Data URI is a method for embedding small images directly in your HTML or CSS code using base64 encoding without the need for additional image files. It's useful when you want to improve performance reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load a webpage, or when you want to distribute a script/HTML page with some icons or other small images, but prefer to keep it in a single file.They can be used both in HTML, where the image data is placed inside src attribute, or in a CSS file, as a background image. This shortcut lets you select one of both ways or just gives you a raw data URI string without the additional code.Data URI in a CSS background property is currently supported by all major browsers and safe to use, unless you care about IE7 and older, and it that case you can add fallback background image property with path to ordinary image file for IE.
Data URI in a HTML image src property is not supported by IE/Edge.Please keep in mind it's usually not useful to embed anything larger than few kilobytes, as it will likely impact performance negatively because these images won't be cached by the browser if used in HTML and will increase CSS parsing time in used in CSS. If you have many small icons, consider using CSS sprites instead.”1.1 - Oct. 1, 2019, 6:04 a.m.- Overall improvements.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThere's a cool pattern I've seen in other shortcuts to offload more complex operations to javascript. It works by essentially making a simple webpage to run js code that does stuff, then outputs the result as text on the main document. The page source is base64 encoded to a URL in shortcuts, which can then be executed, and the contents retrieved as plain text.I wrapped this functionality in a little utility shortcut.Example:Here's a shortcut that makes use of it as an example:_xmlText2jsonText, which uses a javascript library (x2js) to convert xml to json so you can make Dictionaries out of xml data.Usage:_executeJS takes a single Dictionary as input with the following keys:{name}: {type} - description'js':{Text} - The javascript code that will be executed. You must return something at the end of this text. (i.e. return "hello world";). Whatever you return will be the text output of this shortcut. If you return a javascript object or array, it will be serialized via JSON.stringify(), and you'll be able to convert to a Dictionary with the returned text. Otherwise, numbers and strings are left alone.'libs':{Dictionary {'libName',{Text}}} - Optional javascript libraries that your code depends on. The idea here is to keep things organized. The libName doesn't really matter.. that's for you. The lib text content is any javascript that you want defined before your code runs. This can be anything from variable or function declarations, to copied minified libraries from npm or github.'input': {Dictionary | Number | Quoted Text} - Optional data for your javascript to work with. A variable named 'input' will be provided to your script. If input is a dictionary, you'll be working with a javascript object in code. If input is a string, you must enclose in quotes when defined.'debug': {Boolean} - Optional debug switch. When included and 'True', will popup a Quicklook of the script page source before executing. When I'm debugging, I turn this on and copy the page contents to my computer to actually work on the code instead of typing on my tiny phone.Here’s the original Reddit post for this shortcut in case any of the comments help with usage:utility_shortcut_to_run_javascript1.0 - Oct. 21, 2018, 4:46 p.m.Initial versionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackLibrary to execute javascript and get results that can be used in your shortcut.There are two input modes, headless and visible. They serve different solutions.When you run your javascript in headless mode you have to use document.write(...) to produce output results, so long as your javascript is synchronous you can manipulate the document that is passed as output.If you have an asynchronous action (time-out, Ajax, etc) you have to use the visible mode which requires a manual user action to produce output. This is done by using the users clipboard as data Passthrough mechanism. (It restores the original clipboard content when it’s done). To pass results to the users clipboard in visible mode you must callshortcutResult({...})when your script has finished its work. This will prompt the user to tap a button which will populate their clipboard.Input accepts an array of urls for external scripts that need imported for your script to run.1.0.0 - July 27, 2019, 6:09 p.m.Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackEmbedding a set of actions in another shortcut is quite a common practice these days. Copy-and-paste shortcuts such asMergeCutsby@ROPandActionCutsby@atow, as well as embedders for updater shortcuts such asSwing Updater [E]by@D3W10andEmbed-a-Updateby@pfg, all work by editing a shortcut’s property list (plist) form as plain text and converting that back to a .shortcut file.This shortcut takes a different approach to embedding actions. Instead of editing the shortcut astext, this shortcut treats the plist format as adictionary, similar to what the Dictionary action in Shortcuts produces, with the action list as an array. This allows for a more hands-off approach to editing the shortcut and is more reliable.This shortcut is a template for building your own embedder using this new method. Place the actions you would like to embed after the “Begin embeddable” comment at the bottom of this shortcut, rename the shortcut to whatever you like, and edit the dictionary values at the top as needed.1.1 - June 15, 2020, 6:32 a.m.Add option to copy “embed here” text to clipboard if no “embed here” comment is found in the target shortcut.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

(Only took 8 seconds to check through 300+ shortcuts on iPhone XR)!- The previous 2 versions of this shortcut replaces the number found with a new value throughout the whole source. Let's assume a shortcut is using a glyph number 59393 and has a lot of base64 images. There's a chance that some of the images contain the same string 59393 because base64 encoding turns binaries into mostly alphanumeric characters. Then the image will break if you use Replace Text in source.plist because it will find ALL occurrences of 59393. This was a problem that has been squashed in the new version of this shortcut.- Results shown in a Quick Look before generating iCloud links for shortcuts detected will now also be saved in the Note with the links.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

Without an input, selecting options from the UI will simply copy the UUID to the clipboard.If you use this in your shortcuts or as a dependency, please credit me with a link to this original shortcut.2.0 - Jan. 30, 2020, 2:55 a.m.Upgrade to 2.0 to enjoy these new features:• Functions for online and offline UUID generation can be called from inside the shortcut or outside with easy built-in input codes as text: online, offline, and recover (to output the last UUID generated). To use a function, simply use a text action with one of the codes, then a Run Shortcut action with the input being the text action with the code you chose. Whenever a new code is generated, regardless of how, it is backed up. Keep that in mind if you plan on making a shortcut that generates multiple at once.• New modern vCard interface, with toggle for automatic updates. Updates are always skipped when you call a new UUID from outside the shortcut. Dark mode icons coming in a future update.I can’t wait to see what you build with this!

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut has a built-in updater based onPro Updater, and also a bunch of other functions. Please read more about how this work below, or just read the installation instructions if you’re not a developer.If you’re not a developer and you’re here, it’s probably, because a shortcut requires it. You just needActions by Sindre Sorhusin order to install this shortcut. It is used for many functions, formatting folders, and checking for and running updates for shortcuts.This shortcut doesn’t do much when you run it, other than give you the option to clear temporary data, check for updates in shortcuts that support external updates, and give feedback via the feedback Google form. When shortcuts run it with a special input, it will do some things for them to make it easier.One of the best features is the external update which developers can easily add so you can just run this shortcut and select the shortcut you want to updates and if it supported, it will just work!click here to learn more.Here’s a chart of ODT’s built in updater compared to some others:NOTE:Lightning updater does have update skip management. My error in reading the code of it. Sorry lol.If you don’t like the default updater, there’s more options you can override it to in the settings:Note: this was last updated with version 1.3.1 of ODT on October 21, 2023.This will be a list of every function, and its inputs and outputs in this shortcut, but, first, I need to give some extra info:This shortcut creates 4 folders that either are meant to be used by other shortcuts or are only meant to be used by functions. Here is a list of them below:All of the above folders are creating as soon as Omega’s Dev Tools runs no matter the input, before any other function even starts.If you want to support external updates via ODT, which allow users to update in a much easier way by letting them run ODT and allow them to check for updates for your shortcut, create a valid dictionary for the updater function and output that when ran with the inputoutputUpdateInfo. If you don’t understand,click here to learn more.If you require ODT or just support ODT External updates, please put the markdown code below in your shortcuts description on routinehub:[![install ODT](https://i.imgur.com/LGmz236.gif)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/16398/)It should look like this:(Credit to@ProCreationsfor designing this for me)If you want an example forall functions, please check out theODT Exampleshortcut.

Once you have all the apps you need, you’ll just need to press “get shortcut” on this page and get it.1.3.1 - Oct. 18, 2023, 9:17 p.m.Changes:1. Added support for using JAGU as an updater override.2. Fixed a bug where the BitUpdate override option would not work.3. Improved the general speed of ODT4. Replaced the old embed updater with a new one based on Pro Updater [E] by @ProCreations5. Added a 500 character release note limit to make sure that long release notes will still allow you to press the buttons.6. The “dev” input to the updater function is now required and will give an error when not provided.7. It now saves when you skip an update & doesn’t ask you again.8. It now supports a second beta update RoutineHub ID. It will check for beta updates when the version variable contains “beta”, “alpha”, “rc”, “pre”, and/or “test”.9. Now the markdown converter checks if your in light or dark mode and uses the color scheme you’re in as the color scheme to show it.10. Updated icons to my own custom icons11. Replaced the “allowDvToolUpdates” option with a “allowODTupdates” option. (Note: the old name is still compatible, but is not recommended.)12. Updated the Filter Filename Characters function be more easily expandable.Credit: @ProCreations for helping me add Pro Updater [E]Notes: I have some HUGE PLANS for ODT v1.4.0 :)Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

Don’t evaluate more than two variables against each other such as:Instead you can write this as:Logically they mean the same thing however the function can’t handle the former.2. You can pass a single variable for evaluation (without an operator) such as:In this case, it is the equivalent oftesting for non-zero.False if zero, True otherwise.Following from this, you can include single variables in a larger statement such as:3. Check your inputsPass all inputs as numbers or variables that can be converted to numbers. Strings are not yet supported as they present ambiguity. This is because the shortcut itself accepts a string as an input and has to identify the operators. Passing strings as variables could result in improper identification of operators.Spaces have no effect when passing inputs however new lines do.Tips:1.3 - May 30, 2021, 3:10 a.m.Changed the input syntax and added the greater than or equal to and less than or equal to operator.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackSeit v17 verlagert sich der Schwerpunkt des SC auf das automatisierte Erfassen des Status von WLAN (s. Update 0925) und Mobilfunk.
Die Veränderungen erscheinen optional als popup-Meldung und/oder zusätzlich als Datei (Konstanten isPopup bzw. isSaveReport).Sekundär erfährst du einiges über Platform, AppCodeName, UserAgent, Cookie/Java aktiv und Version deines Browsers indem du die Konstante 'isShortVariant' benutzt.Update 1016Mit dieser SC-Version akzeptiert der Kurzbefehl zusätzlich die beiden -seit v17.0 neuen- generischen Automationen:(Da Apple für Automationen keine Downloadlinks ermöglicht, ist hier wieder ein wenig Handarbeit gefordert.)
Im Aktionsfall wird der Status allerdings nicht angezeigt, sondern im Report-Logfile (optional) protokolliert. Auf die übliche popup-Nachricht zwecks Sofort-Ausführen hat Apple verzichtet (oder vergessen?).Update 0925Ab v17.0 bietet die AUTOMATION u. a. die zusätzliche Funktion ‚WLAN trennt‘ (und auch ‚Flugmodus eingeschaltet/ausgeschaltet’) an.
Auf dieser Grundlage habe ich meinen Kurzbefehl so erweitert, das er zwei persönliche Kurzbefehleingaben der Automation akzeptiert:Die Aktionen können optional angezeigt (Konstante isPopup) und gespeichert (Konstante isSaveReport) werden. Die v17.4 erlaubt allerdings immer noch nicht das ‚Voranstellen‘ von Daten, so das man sich in der Dateien-App qualvoll nach unten bewegen muss um die aktuellste Eintragung zu sehen.

- Description: DescriptionFeatures:Latest Release NotesFeedbackA starting template for your next shortcutShortcuts is a wonderful tool - so many brilliant minds have created some great things, and it's only growing faster every day. While this is happening, some newcomers may believe it difficult to get started building "good" shortcuts. starterKit aims to eliminate (or at least reduce) this supposed difficulty, providing some awesome features out of the box.UpdateKit support- This will allow you to provide quick and easy updates to your Shortcut, using RoutineHub. If a user does not have UpdateKit, starterKit makes it really easy for them to fix this.RoutineHub Ready- starterKit includes a "Help & Support" option, which (when used correctly) will lead to your RoutineHub profile.Menu-centric Design- Out of the box, you are provided with a main menu, and a "Settings" option, with "Aboutshortcut title", "Check for Updates" and "Help & Support" sub-options also pre-configured.Simple Configuration- Most of the settings you need to configure are located at the top of starterKit - if there are any extras, it's because you put them there! :)First, download starterKit. Stop. Do not immediately edit it.Instead, duplicate it, and edit the copy. Trust me, this saves the headache of having to re-download starterKit every time you're making a new Shortcut.You'll find a dictionary at the top - fill in the blanks, or replace the information with your next shortcut's details. The "author" field should contain your RoutineHub username - this is so the "Help & Support" option in the Settings menu works correctly. If the user activates this option, it opens Safari to your profile on RoutineHub.Dictionary - "app"
// title, author, version, idNext, you'll need to create a new shortcut on RoutineHub. The "id" field in the dictionary is the "RoutineHub ID" for UpdateKit. Make sure to fill this in also.Once you have completed the steps above, you're ready to start building your shortcut! Have fun - be sure to share with me what you create - Tweet @Dean0DC and show me what you've made!1.1 - June 1, 2019, 6:09 p.m.Fixed “About” alert in SettingsAdded emojis for decorationLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThere is a 3 step process to embed the updater into a shortcut. It may sound like a lot but it's easy to do. The following steps are best when you're connected to the internet so you can view the images.1. Insert a comment with “Update” (no other text) into where you want the updater to be in any shortcut.2. Run Sharp Updater. Select “Embed In A Shortcut”. Follow the steps provided. This will create a new shortcut so it won’t wreck your preexisting shortcut if you dislike the updater.3. Now you should have a new shortcut dowloaded. It is the exact same as your chosen shortcut except with the embedded updater replacing the “Update” comment.Follow the steps on the comments that were embedded with the updater to finish the process. Note that the updater will not work until the shortcut is published. Instead, it will just return a blank white quick look.There are three possible outcomes when someone tries to update the shortcut.Sharp Updater is part of theProCuts Collection, a collection of development-based shortcuts created to empower your shortcuts and shortcutting experience.1.2.0 - May 11, 2021, 7:36 p.m.- Added a notification explaining internet connection is required to embed- New “Support” option.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackIf Action Enhanceradds additional functionality to your If actions by making changes that would otherwise be impossible in the default Shortcuts editor.If action editor works by scanning for specific comments in your shortcut, then creating a new shorcut with the necessary changes made.The comments themselves can be found inside the If Action Enhancer shortcut, and can be pasted into any of your other shortcuts.When the End If block is removed from an If statement, the shortcut editor allows you to move the otherwise block anywhere in your shortcut, which effectively makes the If statement act as a goto!Note:If statements without the End If will terminate the shortcut if they evaluate to true, and you come back to the If statement later in the shortcut execution. It is recommended that you keep the If statement empty when removing the End If, so that it always evaluates to false.To remove the End If block from an if statement, simply paste the corresponding comment above the If action, then run the If Action Enhancer shortcut.After running If Action Enhancer, you will have an If statement that no longer has an End If associated with it. You can then move the otherwise block anywhere in the shortcut, and, provided that the condition is false, your shortcut will immediately jump to that point!Note:Sometimes, the shortcuts editor will not allow you to move the otherwise statement. This can usually be fixed by moving the If block below the otherwise. If that doesn't work, you can also use a repeat statement to move both blocks to the desired location for the otherwise, then move the If block elsewhere.If Action Enhancer can also restore the old iOS 12 handling of if statements in shortcuts made in iOS 13 and 14. This allows you to, for example, compare almost any item type directly, rather than needing to convert them into text first.To do this, first, create an If statement that uses the desired comparison type, then add the desired variable to the left side of the If statement. Then simply paste the corresponding comment above the If action, and run the If Action Enhancer Shortcut.Note:The only comparison types supported are Is, Contains, Greater than, and Less than. Other comparison types will not work properly, as they did not exist in iOS 12.After running If Action Enhancer, the If statement will begin to work exactly as it did in iOS 12. This will even work if the user running the shortcut is on iOS 13 or 14!Note:Making any changes to the comparison operator or to the variable on the left side will undo the modification, and you will need to run If Action Enhancer again to fix it.1.0.1 - June 11, 2021, 6:25 a.m.•Updated the announcement to better explain the bug with the goto functionality and how to prevent it from occurring.•Fixed the announcement incorrectly appearing when the user attempts to use the legacy function rather than the goto function.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

(Yet Another Updater?)If you’re like me, adding a score or more actions to your clean Shortcut just to check for updates feels ... ugh.Embed this 9 Action Snippet to make any Shortcut self-updating. Running at the speed of RoutubeHub’s API, nothing should get between your users and your slick new updates.This bare bones code provides a UX that is surprisingly attractive and functionally complete, with no unnecessary information to distract users from what’s important:1 Theres an update
2. See what’s in it.
3. Click here to get it.Version strings can be anything you like, in any ‘order’ that you prefer. The current RH version will always be presented as an “Update” to any other version.The snippet is a functional shortcut which takes 3 dictionary value parameters via “Shortcut Input”. Once embedded into your own code, connect these three parameters to your Shortcut’s values. (ID, Version, & Name.)When I download a new Shortcut built to use an Updater I don’t want. I often “fix” it to call my own copy of μUpdate, passing in the dictionary as usual. But please don’t direct users to download μUpdate for that purpose2.0 - Oct. 16, 2020, 12:52 a.m.Completely rewritten for significant speed increases.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackUpdateKit APIprovides a fast, free and robust way to allow your users to update your shortcuts automatically. However, the process for implementing it into a shortcut has been less clear and easy than it could be.This shortcut addresses that problem. Just download it and follow the instructions in the enclosed Readme, and you'll be off and running!This shortcut serves as a base for new shortcuts, so that you don't have to copy and paste actions from one shortcut to another, and then fix all the broken references, in order to use UpdateKit API with RoutineHub in your shortcuts.You may be wondering: There are already examples on the UpdateKit API site athttps://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit-api/v1, so why this template?The answer is that while those examples are fine, they are not (and are not intended to be) drop-in templates. This is. Plus, I have made a couple of improvements, such as ensuring that the version check won't error out if there's no network connection, and putting the bulk of the version checking routine under a foldable If action to get it out of the way, that I find worthwhile.Feedback is always welcome, either by leaving a comment below or onTwitter.If this shortcut has been helpful to you, please leave a review below!There is a similar shortcut on RoutineHub calledUpdatekit template. Here's what theUpdateKit API developerhas to say about the two implementations:Both look pretty good to me. They each offer different things. [UpdateKit API Template] implements platform and platformVersion, for example, which works great for Switchblade servers. [Updatekit Template] has the ability to skip a version and remember that selection for the future, and a vCard menu, which some people like.I think both are great and either one would be a good starting point.1.1-b.2 - July 12, 2023, 8:02 p.m.#### Bug fixes- Turned Beta downloads onLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackSquisher is a ShareSheet option in Photos App and Camera App to automate the process of creating resized and optimised images of either specific sizes (Height and Width) for various Social Media platforms as well as optimised sizes based on Longest-Side resizing, so the best of both worlds.Currently we have the majority of sizes for:
LinkedIn
Facebook
Instagram
Pinterest
Twitter
YouTube
Telegram
WooCommerce (including Dokan Multi-Vendor Stores).The resizing process gives you a preview pop-up before continuing and will only create your resized copy if you continue through and will cancel if you choose to cancel during the process.If you choose multiple images to process to a certain size it resizes those images one at a time which is a little slower than doing them all at the end but it prevents the memory issue of only being able to process three or four depending on the power of the iPhone being used. So you can choose as many as you want from the Photos app.You can run the Squisher Shortcut in a widget from your home screen and it will then ask you to choose an image to process from your photos library.Running it from the Camera app is also a great option if you are taking photos on the fly for your platform of choice.The Shortcut adds images to an album named after the media platform those images are being created for and if that album doesn't exist it will create it for you.Please enjoy my shortcut and thanks to various kind people on Reddit's Shortcuts sub-reddit who gave me tips and help while I was learning some more advanced Shortcuts techniques.CheersPaul Randall
https://aztecinternet.com1.3.0 - Nov. 18, 2022, 5:10 p.m.Added a new initial menu to give people the option to resize images based on the choice of either aspect ratio or by social platform.If you choose to resize by social platform then you pick your desired platform and all the resize options for that platform will appear whether they are portrait, landscape, square or by longest edge.If you choose to resize by aspect ratio then all the image resize options of that chosen aspect ratio from a mixed bag of platforms will appear in the next set of choices.It's all the same data but just another way of making it easier to nail down the resize options you require.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut is an easy way to obtain a new search token from the Spotify API. The token is needed to authorize search queries. It lasts for one hour.The shortcut tries to read both your Spotify client id and client secret from a dictionary namedspotifyApiinside your DataJar application. These values are needed to obtain a search token. After successful retrieval, the search token will automatically be written into your DataJar dictionary and can then be used and reused inside all your Spotify search shortcuts.The following steps need to be done in order to make this shortcut work:Create a new app and get your client id and client secret from theSpotify Developer DashboardOpen DataJar, create a new dictionary namedspotifyApiand put both your client id and client secret inside:That's it. I'm using this shortcut in all my other Spotify shortcuts which need a valid search token. Just make the API request by using the current tokenspotifyApi.searchTokenfrom DataJar. If the "Get contents of URL" call returns an error with http state401(unauthorized), just call this shortcut once and afterwards call your own shortcut again. This time it will work (and return http200Success).To summarize: This shortcut is meant as a Spotify utility to obtain a valid search token. The token is stored in DataJar and can be reused all the time as long as it's valid. This saves you time coding your shortcuts, it saves unneeded http api requests and it makes your shortcuts run faster.After you set it up, your DataJar entries should look like this:1.0.0 - May 24, 2020, 11:35 a.m.initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackUpdateR is an updater for all shortcuts currently on RoutineHub. It is extremely easy to integrate with all existing shortcuts on RoutineHub.v2.0.0 Process Update 1:An engine has been finished to replace the simple update checking system for higher stability and speed. A shortcut UI has also been partially completed and the skip update function is being optimised for v2.0.0. A “Check For Updates” function is planned however not started. Multiple decimal support has also been implemented as part of the update engine. Currently, implementing support for worded versions is planned for in the future, preferably v2.0.0.v2.0.0 Progress Update 2:iOS 15 Shortcuts is literally an eyesore to use. Laggy interface, crashing everywhere, and being unable to drag blocks into an area. Constant “There was a problem” errors are persistent in the BETA UpdateR version. Due to this, v2.0.0 will be heavily delayed. Pls fix, Apple. I am also planning to upload the beta version soon, so stay tuned!”Shortcut Name - Text: The shortcut name in RoutineHubVersion - Text: Current Version of shortcutRHID - Text: RoutineHub IDAutoR - Boolean: A true boolean will turn off the notification for no new versionsUpdateR is undeniably quick and well-performing. As of version 1.0, it will only cover the very basics of an updater, only containing 26 actions. This amount may grow to allow for more functions. Future plans may also include having a “skip update” function, shortcut user interface, and a program similar to “Check For Updates”.Please insert this badge into your UpdateR supporting shortcuts.Customised badges may be used as long as the name "UpdateR" is clearly stated (no alternative spellings), contains "This is supported by" or equivalent, contains at the footer "Licensed by @DjPro - RoutineHub - Custom badge by (Your Name Here)", and has the icon.

- Description: DescriptionThemesLatest Release NotesFeedbackMarkdown To Templated HTML provides an easy way to make quick HTMLs for your shortcuts. Input some markdown and choose from one of the themes and you will get a HTML that you can put in your shortcut. Don't just limit this to shortcuts, you can also make other things, like notes or journal entries, using the markdown and converting it to a PDF.This is extremely easy to do.Feel free to share a theme of your own. Fallow thisshortcutto see how you can do this. You will need to have knowledge of CSS and HTML to make a theme.All themes are 100% designed by me or my contributors. They all have a dark mode and a light mode. Also, if you look at the code they can be a bit messy because they where put into a dictionary but the colours can be changed decently easily if you know HTML and CSS.Normal theme was inspired by another one of the shortcuts I've made. There isn't too much colour but it can fit anything you can throw at it.Spear Mint theme was inspired by my favourite Google Slide theme. The colours are plain or green and most of the objects are "sharp" but the text is curved.If you ask me what theme is the worst, it would have to go with this one. The colours were mostly inspired by the eggs you can get at Easter.
* Normal sans-serif font but the titles are a more playful font
* Lists use pink ❊
* Colours are mainly pink, yellow and blue
* Bolded text is pinkThis theme contains lots of chocolate colours. White chocolate, dark chocolate and milk chocolate are all colours in the HTML. This theme could also be called cowboy, because of the font and colours.This theme is inspired by a bee. If you don't have many code or block quotes in the HTML then the light mode will be gray and black only but the dark mode always looks like a bee.This theme has many shades of pink and purple. It is also the first theme that has a gradient. The block quotes and code blocks in light mode are both gradients and the background in dark mode is a gradient.This theme is packed full of blue colours. Every colour you see will be a shade of blue. The text has a serif font so this theme is good for more serious matters.This theme contains lots of green. I thought that I should make a green theme after having other colour themes like blue and pink/purple. This is also the first theme to have a dotted border (horizontal rule).This is the first theme contributed by someone other than me. It is also the first theme with animations. The animations are on horizontal rules, block quotes and links.1.10 - June 8, 2021, 11:13 a.m.- Added a contributing section in help- Added Grape theme- Added Total Blue theme- Added Summer Green theme- Added Night Owl theme by @PEKKA_SLAYER- Themes are in a different orderLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

It supports both iOS 12 and iOS 13.Download the iOS 12 versionAdKit E helps provide your favorite shortcut creators with funds, so they can continue to make great shortcuts. AdKit E shows ads as a small, non-intrusive menu item.AdKit E is easy for shortcut developers to use.Go to https://a-ads.com and make a new ad unit, with the configuration as follows:Type: AppDescription: iOS ShortcutAd type: Adaptive, MixedCreate a vCard menu. If you don’t know how to do this,here is an excellent tutorial.Step One:Use a copy-and-paste shortcut such asCopy And Paste A Shortcutby@robric18to copy AdKit E to the top of your shortcut.Paste a base64-encoded image into the text field that says "Paste base64 encoded ad icon here." This will be the icon for the ad in your vCard menu. You can use your own, or you can copy the encoded icon from the preceding Comment action and paste that into the icon field—that is the ad icon from the standalone version of AdKit.Edit the "Run Shortcut" action near the bottom of AdKit E to run the shortcut containing it after you have copied AdKit E into your shortcut.Step Two:Make a dictionary. The key-value pairs are as follows.Step Three:Place a "Run Shortcut" action after the dictionary. Make sure the dictionary is the input for the Run Shortcut action, and choose the name of your shortcut so that your shortcut will run itself. Turn off "Show While Running."Download an example shortcut to see how this should look:That’s it! When users run your shortcut and need to display the menu, AdKit E will download an ad, append it to the bottom of the menu, and display the menu. If a user clicks the ad, the ad will open in Safari and your shortcut will wait for them to return to Shortcuts before continuing.For more information on how to earn money with AdKit E, visit https://a-ads.com.1.0 - May 23, 2020, 1:32 a.m.Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

It not only finds missing shortcuts but also offers links to download their latest versions.If you have several shortcuts within one, this tool is a smart choice. It even checks online for the latest version and prompts updates.However, please be aware that if you include it in your shortcut, you'll need to keep the dictionaries up-to-date with the latest versions.Just a reminder, the tool doesn't automatically know if users have the latest version. It only downloads what's missing and looks for updates in the existing shortcuts.To easily integrate it into your shortcut, you can use theJoin shortcutsshortcut by user gluebytehere.Credit to 【Auto-Update Routine】
↳https://routinehub.co/shortcut/16590/1.5 - Sept. 19, 2023, 9:39 p.m.SyncUp Update 1.5 🚧This update improves how Shortcuts handles shortcuts that are missing or out of date. We solved a problem where skipping an update or download could incorrectly label the next shortcut as being out of date. It also fixes an issue where a shortcut that was available could wrongly appear as missing.Previously, if you chose not to download the latest version of a shortcut, the Shortcuts app would continue showing it as needing an update. Now it will properly recognize the version you already have installed. We're also ensuring shortcuts that should be available won't get stuck in a "missing" state if you skipped an earlier update.The goal of this release was to enhance the updating experience in Shortcuts. Missing or outdated status notifications should now be more accurate. Let me know if you have any other issues with accessing your shortcuts after installing version 1.5!Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackEthAds adds non-intrusive ethical ads to the bottom of vCard menus.Download the example shortcutAn ethical ad doesn’t track users and is selected by the developer of the shortcut that displays it. These ads run for a set time and then go away.EthAds caches ads in iCloud Drive. Each ad has an expiration date, so once an ad has been downloaded, EthAds will not check for a new ad until the current ad has expired. This minimizes server exposure and helps EthAds run very fast.EthAds doesn’t use an external ad network; instead, it downloads its ads from a location controlled by you, the shortcut developer. I recommend usingGitHub Pagesfor this; it’s fast, it’s free, and it’s relatively user-friendly. If you have your own website, you could also use that to host ads.You will need to devise your own method for selling ad space to interested parties.Ads for EthAds are formatted as a JSON. EthAds checks a master ad JSON on your site, which contains all the ads that you plan to run or have run in the past. EthAds will use the current date to determine which ad it needs to save and display, so you don’t need to worry about deleting ads as soon as they expire.Here’s an example of what the ad file on the server might look like:File location:https://example.com/ads.jsonFile contents:Note that the icons are not stored in the JSON as base64. Instead, their URLs are provided so that only the icon of the currently running ad will be downloaded.Also note that the expiration dates are in the ISO 8601 format to ensure that they are interpreted correctly regardless of the language and region settings of users’ devices.Use a copy-and-paste shortcut such asCopy And Paste A Shortcutby@robric18to embed EthAds at the top of your shortcut.There are several comments throughout EthAds that explain how to configure it. You can delete those comments when you have finished configuring EthAds.EthAds is based onAdKit E, another ad-delivery system for Shortcuts that uses A-ADS instead of ethical ads.1.0 - July 8, 2020, 4:26 a.m.Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut usesToolbox ProBeta's upcoming OpenAI integration to constitute a single-query, single-response "chatbot" integrating with the OpenAI API directly emulatingthe "JavaScript helper chatbot" example in the OpenAI documentation.At install, you will be prompted to specify the default response length of replies. As theOpenAI example playgroundis configured, this length is "60 tokens," but I have personally found great success with ~200. You will also be asked to specify a Cheatsheet folder in which to store responses.By default, the shortcut will store the responses in bothCheatsheet for iOSandSimplenote for iOS. You may choose either/or by retaining or deleting the appropriate actions.If you intend to use this shortcut repeatedly, you'll want tosignup for a free OpenAI developer accountto take advantage of its much higher usage cap.0.1 - Aug. 6, 2022, 11:54 p.m.Initial (beta) release.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackInspired by @entee’s “Shortcut Projects” This Shortcut is a work-in-progress.Put this Shortcut in a folder containing Shortcuts you're developing.To function correctly it currently needs to be run in Edit mode. (It may work as a Widget. Sometimes.)To return to the menu you'll need to wiggle the Shortcuts app window to trigger the "Wait to return" action.Backup links are found in /Shortcuts/Backup Links/{Folder Name}/{Shortcut Name}It’s not ideal, but much simpler to use than it sounds. I’ve found using this can really speed up my development process. And some tasks it just makes so much easier!

After all, it is only 4 actions, and it’s very easy to setup.And also, once you set it up, you’ll never have to touch it again — because of the way it’s built,very smol updater automatically updates itself!Up-to-date instructions on how to embed it in your Shortcut are available onvery smol updater’s website.Unfortunately, copying the actions from this template Shortcut and pasting them into another Shortcut causes problems with Magic Variables, and adding the actions into your Shortcut yourself is easier than trying to fix the issues you’d get by copy-pasting the actions.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackこのショートカットでは, 予め「ファイル」アプリに保存したplist形式のテキストファイルを辞書として読み込み, 中にあるルール付けられた関数を適用して必要に応じて4種類の値を表示します.<key>favorite function name</key><array><string>x+1</string><string>変数</string></array>と, keyに好きな関数名を書き, 配列arrayの先頭に数式, その後ろに対応する変数をすべて書き並べます.配列array内のstring要素が一つの場合は定数として扱います.<key>favorite function name</key><array><string>123</string></array>定数で例えば<string>123.4^-5</string>と入力すると123.4×10^(-5)として扱われます.こうして作成したplist形式のテキストファイルを「ファイル」アプリの"Shortcuts"フォルダの中に保存します.保存先のファイルパスをレシピの一番上にある「テキスト」アクションで指定することで初めて機能します.C言語で関数を呼び出す際にfunction(1,2)などと書いてコールする代わりに, このレシピでは辞書アクションを使って例えば下のように記述します.辞書の値は必ず「配列」にし, 定数の場合は項目数が0のままに, 数式の場合は配列の中に数字を入れます.追加する数字の並びはplistで定義した並びと同じにする必要があります.デフォルトで正しく数式を呼び出した場合は画像のようになります(画像は上記画像にある辞書の内容を引数として判別式b^2-4acの定義式を呼び出した例).当然, 引数となる数たちはマジック変数を用いることも可能です.あるいは画像のように引数を「入力を要求」のたびに「変数に追加」で格納していき…この変数を引数として「辞書」アクションの値にしても同じように実行されます.実際に使う場合はこちらの使い方が現実的でしょう.0.1 - Nov. 8, 2020, 1:24 a.m.リリースLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

It’s a simple action and shouldn’t require a laptop, but it was virtually impossible for me to do it on the go.I tried two ways:This shortcut adds a ”View source” button to Safari and sends you to a web app which processes the source code, so it looks nice and easy to work with (or, at least as easy as possible with that screen size)Accessible through the shortcut or directly throughview-source.hellafast.digitalon Android1.0 - July 2, 2021, 4:24 p.m.Shortcut createdLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis library is fairly basic, but offers functionality that isn’t already in any native action. You can pass a dictionary of 2 data sources and it will send back what is different. It can compare a single set of same type data (text+text,number+number,bool+bool,etc) or a whole set of data inside a dictionary. For the dictionaries to work it must be an identical structure. (Other structure comparisons haven’t been tested)If you need to see what things were changed in a form that had been edited, this is perfect. You can log that data out to a file or a data jar, or global variable, etc.Personally I needed it in a complex and robust shortcut that I built to handle gift certificates in a massage spa. I wanted to track what was edited and when, and by who. I just pass the data and bam... the changes are returned almost instantly. I log it all out to a data jar field and can view it any time.If you have any feedback please let me know! I plan to make a much more feature rich library (CompareKit) if this gets enough traction.1.0 - March 5, 2021, 7 a.m.Initial version.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackAirdrop alternative using rsync. In many cases, RSYNCdrop works faster and more reliably than airdrop. RSYNCdrop should also work on Windows devices.RSYNCdrop saves a file to the iCloud Drive, which is then 'rsynced' to a destination folder. This obviously requires root access and ssh, which are given on jailbroken devices. Once transfer is complete, the shortcut deletes the file from iCloud Drive.You NEED to set up a shared SSH key between the devices in order for it to work, as I couldn't find a way to bypass the SSH password otherwise. My other shortcut, RSYNCdrop 2, uses sshpass, but it stops working after a while for some unspecified reason.To set up the sharedd SSH key, Use this link (http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html). The host device should be your iDevice.The shortcut is best used when attached to the share sheet.Tested on iOS 13/14, checkra1n and Unc0ver.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackWhat follows is the full text ofthe blog postI wrote on this shortcut:During the course ofmy iPhone Keyboarding project, I managed to discover "a command line tool to document and describe keyboard shortcuts in a standardized and properly formatted way" calledksc. It's a Python utility that translates natural-language-formatted keyboard commands "command control q" into symbolized and standardized form:⌃+⌘+Q. Though it's not of particular use to me at this point, with my now well-establishedText ReplacementsandTextExpander Snippets, I realized - being a Python thing - that ksc might work with the iOS/iPadOS shell emulator,a-Shell, and therefore, that a Siri Shortcut for converting plain language input to formatted key commands might be a cinch, and it was!Using anAsk For Inputaction, my shortcut will prompt you to enter a natural language keyboard command. For the fullest explanation of supported inputs, seeksc's documentation. Your inputted command will be "transformed" via Actions' action into "dash-case" and placed within a command in the following format:By default, the arguments-msand-pare included, but these are entirely optional. From said docs:There are several command line options to modify the output. The-msor--modifier-symbolsoptions output the modifers as unicode symbols:Apple says you should include a plus sign between symbols, but I think that it looks
ugly, so that's not the default. If you want it, add the-por--plus-signwhen
using-ms:Creating a text file for each command within a-Shell may not be Best Practices, per se, but it's the simplest method I've found of reliably retrieving text back from the app within Siri Shortcuts. That said, the above command creates a text file containing the formatted output. AGet Filea-Shell action paired with aGet Text From Inputnative action then retrieves the file contents, which is first cleaned up via another Actions action (trimming leading and trailing whitespace) before being copied to the system clipboard.1.0 - July 2, 2022, 6:30 a.m.Initial release.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackView a Routinehub shortcut's changelog with a customizable HTML in your shortcutsShortcut Changelog is a shortcut containing a snippet that creates a changelog out of all the versions of a Routinehub shortcut. The changelog can be styled differently but follows the relative form ofw3school's timeline. Shortcut Changelog also contains instructions for embedding, styling, and using the snippet.If you do not want to use the snippet in your shortcuts, you can still view any shortcut on Routinehub's changelog using Shortcut Changelog. Just share the shortcut link from Routinehub to the shortcut or copy the id or link of the shortcut and select the View Changelog option when running Shortcut Changelog.The Shortcut Changelog snippet worked pretty easily. It runs on shortcuts and uses a bit of JavaScript to create the changelog. Unfortunately, since iOS15 shortcuts cannot edit plists, so you will have to embed the snippet manually. Luckily, the snippet is only 7 actions and is decently easy to add.1.0 - Oct. 5, 2021, 11:42 a.m.- First release- View a changelog of any Routinehub shortcutLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackSeethe macOS versionof this shortcut to export signed .shortcut files locally.This is a modification of Federico Viticci’s “Shortcut Injector,,” about which you can read more details in “Creating, Modifying, and Signing Shortcuts on macOS.” It is identical tothe version I published for macOSwith additional considerations for performing the signatures remotely over SSH. At install, you will be prompted to specify:
1. The address of the host Mac on which signatures will be performed.
2. The username of the account on said host Mac from which you will be signing.
3. A port (other than22) to use for the SSH connection.
4. The password of said user account on the host Mac.You will also need to explicitly set two directories: one for the pre-signed, post-export files saved only because they cannot otherwise be passed to the export tool (most will want to delete these, I assume,) and another to be the final destination of the signed output files. The first is just aFolderaction set toAsk Each Timeand the second is a simpleTextaction that represents a pointer originating from your home folder (~).shortcuts sign -m anyone -i "Pre-Signed Export Path" -o "Signed.shortcut"I should note that by default, the shortcut comes with aText Caseaction designed to transform the input shortcut’s original filename intocamel case, mostly because I am 100% fed up with URL-encoded links’ tendency to illicit inexplicable and inconsistent behavior from iOS apps, at least.That said, please note that said Text Case action is100% optional. Substitute aRename Fileaction if you’ d like.After theRepeat With Eachcycle completes (and the files are signed,) an additional remote command is run:ls -1 -d "$PWD/Your specified directory/"*...and the result - an unformatted list of thefull file pathfor every signed shortcut in the directory - is copied to the clipboard and finally shown viaQuick Look.You can find the source files - includingan HTML overview- inthe /shortcuts directory of my iOS GitHub Repository.Video DemoFor good measure, here’s the result ofshortcuts help sign:1.0 - March 31, 2022, 3:48 p.m.Initial release.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThe app store is a digital marketplace where users can discover, download, and install applications (apps) onto their mobile devices or computers. It serves as a centralized platform where developers can distribute their software and users can access a wide range of applications.
Buy this is the shortcut to it.
Here are some key features and aspects of the app store:Platform: The app store typically corresponds to a specific operating system, such as the Apple App Store for iOS devices (iPhone, iPad) or the Google Play Store for Android devices. Each platform has its own app store, although there are also third-party alternatives available.
App Discovery: The app store provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to search, browse, and discover new applications. Users can explore different categories, view app descriptions, screenshots, user ratings, and read reviews to help them make informed decisions about which apps to download.
App Distribution: Developers can submit their applications to the app store for review and distribution. The submission process involves providing information about the app, uploading necessary files, and adhering to the app store's guidelines and policies. Once approved, the app becomes available for users to download.
Paid and Free Apps: The app store offers both free and paid applications. Free apps can be downloaded and used without any cost, while paid apps require users to purchase them before installation. The app store handles the financial transactions for paid apps, taking a percentage of the revenue as a commission.
In-App Purchases: Many apps offer additional features, content, or virtual goods through in-app purchases. Users can buy these items directly from within the app, and the app store facilitates the payment process.
Updates and Maintenance: App developers can release updates to their apps, introducing new features, bug fixes, and improvements. The app store notifies users about available updates, and they can choose to install them manually or enable automatic updates.
Ratings and Reviews: Users can rate and review apps in the app store, sharing their experiences and opinions. These ratings and reviews help other users gauge the quality and reliability of an app.
Security and Trust: App stores prioritize security and safety. They employ various measures to verify the authenticity and integrity of apps to protect users from malicious software. This includes reviewing apps before publication, implementing security checks, and allowing users to report suspicious apps.
Developer Ecosystem: App stores support a thriving developer ecosystem by providing tools, documentation, and resources to assist developers in creating, testing, and distributing their apps. They may also offer analytics and monetization options for developers to track app performance and earn revenue.
Geographic Availability: App stores are typically accessible worldwide, but certain apps may have geographical restrictions based on licensing agreements or regional regulations. Availability may vary for some apps across different countries or app store platforms.
It's important to note that while the above description generally applies to most app stores, each platform may have its unique policies, guidelines, and features.1.0.0 - May 17, 2023, 6:46 a.m.-Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut is a template meant to be embedded near the beginning of a shortcut that calls on other shortcuts. It allows you to specify one or more dependent shortcuts. When the user runs the shortcut it will check that dependent shortcuts are installed, and if not, prompt the user to install each missing dependency, thus simplifying the setup process for users.For each dependency, you can specify a RoutineHub ID, or an iCloud shortcut URL, or some other URL. When a RoutineHub ID or iCloud URL is used, users will be prompted with a direct download/install for the shortcut. If some other URL is used, that URL will be opened.Limitations: This only works for dependent Shortcuts, not Apps, due to no ability to check if an App is installed on a device (other than the Toolbox Pro action for doing that, but then how do you check if Toolbox Pro is installed?!)Use this shortcut as a starting point to build your shortcut, or use the “Join Shortcuts” shortcut to easily embed this into your existing shortcut. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10038/1.0.3 - Feb. 25, 2024, 1:12 a.m.* Move the "Nothing" block at the end to inside the repeat loop, so that the repeat loop results are a list of nothing, slightly reducing memory usage.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackDISCLAIMER: You need to know the SSH info of a device on the same network as the devices to ping!Before you install, make sure you know:
- The SSID (name) of the Wi-Fi network all the devices are on
- The IP of a bridge device that you can SSH into and can access other devices on the network
- The SSH user and password of that device and make sure it has SSH enabled
- The command to ping an IP on that device's terminalThis shortcut automatically uses the ping command for a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS.If you change the ping command, scroll down to the bottom of the shortcut and edit what the "Run script over SSH" block runs. If you do change the ping command, you MUST make sure you add modifiers to limit the amount of times it pings! Most ping commands will ping indefinitely until stopped, so look at the documentation of the command before editing.Thanks to @Calion for the UpdateKit API Template!1.1 - Jan. 10, 2024, 12:24 a.m.Added setup questions that I forgot :)Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackIf you've ever seen a fancy menu in a shortcut with icons next to the menu items, that's a vCard menu! This works by repurposing contact list menus, and can really elevate the user experience of a shortcut for an end user.The problem with these menus as a developer, however, is that theysuckto make, especially if you're working with icons. A single menu can be a huge block of text, and replacing an icon (especially during development) is just an absolute pain that I don't recommend. There are apps likeToolbox Pro(RIP Alex Hay) andActionsthat have "Create Menu Item" actions (among many other useful tools), but then you have to require your users install that and it just becomes a huge pain.What this shortcut does is it lets you use those apps to build a menu using their menu creation options, and once you're finished you can export your menu as plain text to paste into your other shortcut! This can save significant amounts of time and energy while iterating on a design, and has personally been a wonderful addition to my arsenal of tools.This shortcut will require iCloud Drive to be enabled with some space available in it, as this requires writing files to disk.1.0.0 - Nov. 12, 2023, 2:52 a.m.Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut is an easy way to obtain a new access token from the Spotify API. The token is needed to authorize changes of user data like playlists, music output targets etc.The shortcut tries to read your Spotify client id, client secret, username and refresh token from a dictionary namedspotifyApiinside your DataJar application. These values are needed to obtain an access token. After successful retrieval, the access token will automatically be written into your DataJar dictionary and can then be used and reused inside all your Spotify search shortcuts.I'm using this shortcut in lots of my other Spotify shortcuts which need a valid access token. Just make the API request by using the current tokenspotifyApi.accessTokenfrom DataJar. If the "Get contents of URL" call returns an error with http state401(unauthorized), just call this shortcut once and afterwards call your own shortcut again. This time it will work (and return http200Success).To summarize: This shortcut is meant as a Spotify utility to obtain a valid access token. The token is stored in DataJar and can be reused all the time as long as it's valid. This saves you time coding your shortcuts, it saves unneeded http api requests and it makes your shortcuts run faster.1.0.2 - June 11, 2023, 9:34 p.m.initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

I originally intended to create this Shortcut becausethe "official" Mastodon iOS/iPadOS appdid not/does not contain the option to view all of one's bookmarks, though there are several other clients which do and have (see the list near the bottom.)I have personally found it useful, however, beyond this function - especially in tandem withData Jar- as a means of storing bookmarks data more manipulatably.(Please note: if you do not intend to use this shortcut with Data Jar, you'll need to delete its action.)Upon installation, you'll be prompted to set your target instance URL (in the formatmastodon.online,) an optional limit on the number of bookmarks you intend to retrieve, and you'll be asked to providea Mastodon application access token.By default, it's configured to store both the entirety of the JSON response (see an example below) as well as a custom dictionary version of response parameters in two separate Data Jar "jars."1.0 - Oct. 22, 2022, 5:27 a.m.Initial release.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

If you have any snippets that you would like to share, please leave a comment and I'll add them to the next version of this shortcut.Here's a list of techniques currently included in this shortcut...Within the shortcut, there is a mainChoose from Menuthat includes the following items:As an example, here are two dialogs, one fromPick Subset of Shortcuts - all | select | textand one fromCreate vCard Menu with SF Symbol Photos.In addition, the shortcut includes embedded actions that provide techniques:This shortcut was tested usingiOS 13.3.1 (17D5026c) beta 1on aniPad Pro 10.5"and aniPhone 8 Plus.3.6 - Jan. 10, 2020, 7:45 p.m.New Techniques:- Added 'SF Symbol for vCard Menu' (to new main menu item)Modifications:- Added 'MyTagline' to the help output [Create Help and Display in Safari (Markdown Source)]- Added comments throughout to clearly indicate the start of each menu item- In [Embed-a-Update] section, changed the vCard menu icon to iOS 13 colorsBug Fixes:[in section: Determine if an alert should be displayed because a specified number of days have elapsed since the shortcut was last run]- The 'Get File' action was incorrectly referencing a Dictionary value that didn't exist. It was referencing 'Settings File'; it has been corrected to 'Settings Path'.)- The 'Get Value for Start Time in File' was incorrectly referencing (via a magic variable) the 'Get File' action in the previous section. Because of this bug and the previous, the shortcut worked as expected. Two wrongs made a right; sometimes you get lucky, even with bugs!)Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackRecursion is a powerful tool in programming. It's the idea that an algorithm can call itself. Factorial is a great example of this:4! = 4 * 3!3! = 3 * 2!2! = 2 * 1!1! = 1iOS Shortcuts also support recursion, in other words, a Shortcut call call itself. This has a variety of applications.The dangerous thing is that if a Shortcut supports UpdateKit, it might try to run UpdateKit each time it calls itself. UpdateKit takes a few seconds to run, so this process could take a long time.This Shortcut is an example of how to handle recursion well with UpdateKit.It works like this. All recursive algorithms have what’s known as an exit condition. It’s basically an if-statement that checks whether or not to recurse again. Recursive Shortcuts don’t have to have an exit condition, but they should. You should put all your UpdateKit actions in the branch of the exit condition that’s called when it’s not about to recurse.Download the Shortcut, play around with it, see how it works, maybe even tweak it a little bit, then integrate the ideas into your own Shortcut.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackUsageKit was designed to give you detailed information on not only how you use your Shortcuts, but how frequently you use them.Caution:This Shortcut is currently in beta, you may experience issues.Graphics byMediaKit28-7-2019:Due to the changes made by Apple in the latest version of their operating system, any Shortcut created using iOS 13 (and iPadOS) will no longer be compatible with earlier versions such as iOS 12.Note:iOS 13 is not yet supported, sorry for the inconvenience.With UsageKit, any data collected from supported Shortcuts will remain on your device and offline.The biggest concern for anybody when it comes to implementing UsageKit will most likely be the impact it has on performance. Due to the way UsageKit works, it will have next to no impact on your performance.If you use more than once device, UsageKit will only show you statistics for the device you’re currently using.UsageKit features a simple, data fuelled interface that keeps the important information at your fingertips. When you run UsageKit you will be greeted by a list of supported Shortcuts and the number of times you’ve run it. When you make a selection you will be presented with more detailed information about the statistics that Shortcut is monitoring.Below you will find detailed instructions on both the basic and advanced implementation of UsageKit. The basic version will only require 4 Actions from you, and the advanced version will use a minimum of 5 Actions. To see this in action, use theDEMOprovided.Note:If you experience any issues or require assistance, don’t hesitate to contact me via Reddit.The basic implementation of UsageKit only requires 4 Actions, this particular method is only used for 1 input and is required at least once in every Shortcut.To get started, place a”Get My Shortcuts Action”and add an”If Action”after it. Set the If Action input to”Contains”and enter”UsageKit”into the Value.Next, place a”Text Action”and paste the text from the template below into the box.First Line:The first line should contain the name of your Shortcut and should match the name that is in your Shortcut Library.Second Line:Leave this blank.Third Line:The third line will be the name of the statistic. For example, if your Shortcut is tracking downloads, you would set your statistic name to “Downloads”.Fourth Line:Leave this blank.Fifth Line:The fifth line will be used to display your Shortcut satistics and must include“{{NUM}}”(you may place any text around this). For example, if your Shortcut is tracking downloads, your your last line will read{{NUM}} items.And to finally finish the basic implimention, add a”Run Shortcut Action”at the end and link it to UsageKit.Note:It is required that you use the template above at least once near the beginning of your Shortcut. This will be used to calculate the total times you run a Shortcut and is needed for the main menu.The advanced implementation of UsageKit requires a minimum 5 Actions, this particular method is only used to send multiple statistics to UsageKit at once.To get started, place a”Text Action”and enter the required information (see basic input). Then add aAdd to Variable Action”and enter”UsageKit”into the name (you can repeat this as many times as you like throughout the Shortcut).Near the end of your Shorcut, place a”Get My Shortcuts Action”and add an”If Action”after it. Set the If Action input to”Contains”and enter”UsageKit”into the Value.Finally, add a”Get Variable Action”linking to the variable we created and place a”Run Shortcut Action”at the end and link it to UsageKit.If you feel UsageKit is the right fit for you and your Shortcuts, you may use the following on your RoutineHub page.[![UsageKit](https://i.imgur.com/LfJufxJ.png)](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2114)0.1 - Feb. 26, 2019, 10:44 a.m.- Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbacka new approach on VCF menu’s.
Some of the creators in the community like me amongst many others are looking into making their shortcuts more fluent and cleaner.Charles Reed sparked the idea of making the VCF menu’s in a shortcut Dictionary based.
So basically what happens in this shortcut is that the dictionary is populated with the needed data.When the shortcut is ran every VCF menu needed is pre generated and can be pulled at any moment by inserting two actions.So in the end this makes the menu’s needed way cleaner. No longer large blocks of text in the editor. Just everything stored away in one variable.Let me know if you have any remarks in the comments, still learning every day.1.0 - Aug. 2, 2022, 1:51 p.m.InitialLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

For more details, please visit our Github page.
https://github.com/HakimbhbV 4 - Feb. 16, 2023, 4:23 p.m.Hello everyone!We've decided to make a final change to our shortcut, as the cost associated with using our API has become too much. We are sad to announce that this means we will no longer be using our API in the shortcut, however it is still available for use. To ensure you can continue to use this shortcut, we have added some instructions on how to use your own API instead.We'd like to thank you all for understanding and we look forward to working with you all again on more projects in the future. Thank you!Steps:https://github.com/Hakimbhb/Chatgpt-TN-ProLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackWarnings:DO NOT USE WITH SIRISAVE YOUR PROMPT BEFORE GENERATION———————————————————————Example of this shortcut’s work at the bottom.————————————————————————This is a backrooms level creator, a shortcut that allows you to easily create backrooms levels. Make sure you have a chatGPT account you can use.First, after the intro, it will ask you to provide the number of your level, this can be anything you want, just make sure that’s the number you want.Second, it will ask you for a name. You have 3 options, to generate a name, make your own name, or not to make one (Your level will just be called your number). If you choose to generate a name, it will be generated after level description is given.Thirdly, it will ask you for a detailed description of your level. It doesn’t have to be too detailed, but if you want to make your level exactly like you want, you would want to be detailed.Finally, it will say that it is generating the level, it will ask you if you want to start a new chat (New chat is definitely recommended), and what model you want to use. It will warn you that if you choose GPT-4, it may generate an image instead. Once the level is generated, you can review it, and then either speak it out loud, save it (as a note), or destroy it.That’s pretty much it! It only takes ~10 seconds to generate the level. This chatGPT has been trained on most of the backrooms wiki and multiple guides on how to create a good backrooms level. Make sure to save your prompt before generating just in case it isn’t how you want. I will be updating this a lot.———————————————————————————————Example (Warning: Long):———————————————————————————————Level 237 (Qwerty) is the 238th level of the Backrooms. It is classified as a Class 2 level, considered Unsafe and Unsecure. The Entity Count on this level varies, ranging from Low Entity Count to Moderate Entity Count, with occasional instances of High Entity Count due to provocation, and Entity Infestation if severe.Description of the Level:
Level 237 presents itself as an endlessly extending hallway with uniformly white-painted walls. The absence of a visible roof gives the impression of an infinite void overhead, although it is suspected that the upper space is obscured by a thick mist (though unconfirmed). Along both sides of this corridor are small offices, each equipped with standard computer setups featuring keyboards, mice, and chairs for users. These offices are arranged haphazardly and continue as far as the eye can see.Within these offices, facelings may be encountered, but it's crucial not to provoke them by interfering with the computers. These entities remain docile until the computers are turned off, at which point they may become hostile. A notable hazard on this level is the dense mist that envelops the entire area. Prolonged inhalation of this mist can prove toxic, although wearing medical face coverings can provide adequate protection.Bases, Outposts, and Communities:
Survivors on Level 237 have established makeshift outposts within some of the offices, using the computers for communication and data gathering. These outposts serve as bases of operation, enabling limited survival in this challenging environment. The mist's toxicity has prompted the creation of specialized face masks to ensure the safety of those residing in these outposts.Entrances and Exits:
Access to Level 237 is primarily gained through random entry points within the Backrooms. Exiting the level can be just as unpredictable, as wanderers may find themselves transported to other areas without warning. Communication and information transmission about this level have been sporadic due to its inherent dangers, making it challenging to disseminate knowledge to others.Please note that the exact nature of Level 237 remains under investigation, and the mist's origins are yet to be confirmed. Wanderers are advised to exercise caution and avoid provoking facelings if they wish to navigate this level safely.2.00 - Nov. 23, 2023, 11:59 p.m.Added multiple variations to the prompts for generating levels, allowing you to choose.Changed the wording of some of the speakingAllowed you to view the format the level will be in.Allowed you to copy it to clipboard.Made main prompt much, MUCH, better.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet
