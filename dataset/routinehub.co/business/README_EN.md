- Source: https://routinehub.co

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut is part of a longer list of shortcuts that help you maintain a diary inBear.You need this shortcut in order to run all the other in this series.You'll need an iCloud account with space in it to save the reference to the latest note and the date it refers to.
For more details on this refer to the end of this description.This is the shortcut that does most of the heavy lifting in this series of shortcuts.When you open this shortcut you're going to be prompted with the following question:What do you want to add to your diary?After you enter some text and confirm, the text you entered is going to be added to a note on Bear that looks like the following:Your text#Diary/2019/01/27If you run it again, you're asked the same question and your note will look like the following after you answer it.Your textYour new text#Diary/2019/01/27If you're familiar with Bear you must have noticed the tag at the bottom and how that creates a tag structure that will look like the following after some time:Diary2019012728293031020102I mentioned input in the beginning and that's because there are other ways how to get data into this shortcut.
One of the ways is through the share sheet.
You can use it to add any kind of content into your Diary. If you add a photo you're going to end up with the following note:Your textYour new text#Diary/Image#Diary/2019/01/27The note above contains a new type of tag. This helps you finding notes with similar types of files.
You can end up with the following tag structure.Diary2019012728293031020102ImageMediaI’ve only tested with images and audio files, but feel free to experiment with other types and let me know in the comments which other tags it creates.A reference file is used to keep track of the latest note you created. This is created in your Shortcuts folder on your iCloud account. This contains a small JSON like the one next. This JSON will only contain one entry so it won’t take more space than initially.1.00 - Jan. 27, 2019, 1:37 p.m.First public versionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

• look for events that have already begun a specified time ago as well as upcoming events
• limit events found in other ways, such as no all-day events, ability to exclude particular calendars, etc.

It provides a simple yes/no list option to choose if you want that function to run or not.And if you choose to send an email, it'll construct and send the whole email for you - even prompting you for details to include in the message.This shortcut is still a work in progress, and i'm hoping to expand it further to offer (in my current order of preference):Assist the user to create one or more address book contacts if they don't already have them setup for their phone or email (In Progress);Better constructions of IF statements (Close to done; but still need a way to loop back or repeat a step if needed - i.e. you want to try calling again after the second step, or want to send the email instead then attempt the call again at a later stage);Store and edit persistent preferences in the app, i.e changing who calls and emails are to, which email address you want to send email messages from, etc;Ability to send a message by Message and/or SMS;Send email messages To multiple people (Technically supported, but still satisfying myself it works);Select one or more contacts to CC (or even BCC) a message to;Allow the user to store a sequence of DTMF tones, for people with employers who take tardy reporting by phone using an IVR service;Test device for existing email account configuration, and deep-linking to settings if the user doesn't have one and wants to set one up for sending messages;Reduce the number of inputs needed for selecting the desired contact types - i.e. instead of asking seperately if you want to call, then if you want to email, rolling these into a single input option;Make list of reasons for being late user editable and order adjustable;Provide a way of the user changing how their email is constructed - from subject line content, the message body, and variables you want included in the message subject/body, and where to use them;Ability to use a different email template and options to when you actually can't come into work;Handsfree - be able to run the shortcut with just your voice (great if you're dealing with an ill child, or one who's running late getting ready for school);Keep track of your tardies, in a CSV file or other resource, for your own review and reporting if and when you may need it.Ability to send a message by addtional means (i.e. Microsoft Teams, Workplace by Facebook, smoke signals, IPoAC IPv6, singing telegram, etc);Read your mindMake a call using a computer-generated voice to provide information to your employer when they answer your call (because i'm sure they'd rather speak to the real you, unless they have an automated service for tardy reporting)This shortcut is commented within an inch of its life, so should you want to work on your own version, or help me make improvements - please feel welcome to go right ahead and do so.If you'd like to buy me a hot chocolate as a token of your appreciation, feel free to do so:PaypalBank TransferFor Australia: Via PayID to[email protected]; orEurope: IBAN BE78 9670 2400 0186Anywhere else in the world, or just to send a small message of thanks:Contact me on twitter.0.02a - June 16, 2020, 1:54 p.m.Corrected missing information for UpdateKit integration and updating.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

This is really handy for those times when you are between meetings and you do not have time to sit and compose an email with the meeting notes and action items.The shortcut will prompt you for the following items to dictate:There are only three settings that need to be set before you begin using the shortcut.Setting the numberedList value in the configuration dictionary to True or False will set how the action items will be formatted in the email. When dictating the action items in order create separate list items you must saynewlineafter each item. E.g.Setting numberedList to True will format the items as an ordered list like this:and setting numberedList to False will format them as a bulleted list like this:This shortcut does require that you have made at least one email account available to Shortcuts. Just add the email addresses you want to use for the From and To fields in the Send email action.The shortcut will display the compose window so you will have an opportunity to add additional email addresses in the To field and edit the contents before the email is sent.1.2 - Nov. 21, 2018, 6:36 p.m.Removed dependency on markdown web serviceLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackWhere Next (andRunning Late) are impoved versions of these (rather standard) shortcuts found elsewhere (see credits). They have similar functionalities in that they relate to how much time you have to leave or get to a destination (or how late you are). Where Next provides driving directions to your next event, andRunning Latemessages who you're meeting that you're running late. Therefore, the text outputs are worded accordingly (and end with those different actions).Improvements/changes include:• allow fudge room time
• look for events that have already begun a specified time ago as well as upcoming events
• limit events found in other ways, such as no all-day events, ability to exclude particular calendars, etc.
• more sensible contextual information, better wording, and more appropriate displays
• configurable options (nudge time, minutes before to look, etc.)
• Where Next uses Google Maps by defaultScreenshots:

Match counts and visual indicators.
Search looks for incomplete reminders/future calendar dates, all notes and all contacts.Searching in reminders/calendar/contact items is case sensitive, whereas notes is not. Best to stick to either #tagginglowercase or #TaggingPascalCase, but not mixing both methods.
- Reminders, incomplete are searched.
- Calendars looks at future events in the next 3 years
- Notes, part matching happens eg #test will return #testing
- Selecting multiple tags test if any are present, not all.
- Notes searches only returns 26 results currently, as the Shortcut looks to see if a # is present first of all, this could cause less than 26 results to be found.
- Incorrect tags might be found if you have html in your notes/reminders etcI made this so I could call as a function from other Shortcuts I use as well.FindTags is the part that looks for the presence of tags, and selects them, it only needs the function name passed as a dictionary.SearchForTags will search for a tag and show the results found, it needs a tag/tags passed to it as a list as well as the function name.1.01 - April 8, 2019, 8:17 p.m.Add priority to reminder viewLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet
