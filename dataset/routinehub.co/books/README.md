- Description: DescriptionJoin theDiscordLatest Release NotesFeedback⚠️ With regret I'm saying here that this shortcut is going to be unsupported for as long as haven't found a good method to work with my interface under iOS 14. I may, however, one day return with a full app to replace / realise Blind Diary once again. Personally, I'm currently using a folder in the notes app with an automation to create the diary page each afternoon.Ever wanted to write a diary? Not exactly a fan of handwriting? And all the apps on the App Store either cost a fortune or are simply not fun to use? Don’t enjoy always seeing a wall of text of previous entries? Perhaps this shortcut can be a good alternative.Blind Diaryallows you to make new entries on the go, automatically adds date and time and saves them to a file. You can always access it through the shortcut, but won’t be shown the contents without asking for them.Everything is automatic: Your diary will be ready on the first runAdding entrieswithin the shortcut or in any other text editor (using share sheet)Viewing statisticsabout your Diary (with share functionality)Viewing the Diary(using HTML pages) as a whole or reading individual entriesEditing Entriesfrom the pastExporting your Diaryas an HTML Page, a fully customisable plaintext file or as a ready-to-print PDF journal/bookEarning Badgesfor being an active writer! Motivate yourself and earn the benefits to a healthier lifestyle2.5 - June 9, 2020, 9:17 p.m.❤️ Enjoying Blind Diary? Consider leaving a like on the RoutineHub page!• Stats now Display average character, word, and sentence counts (Ø).• Stats, Badges and (partially) Graphs now support going back to menu, and will display their content immediately if opening them again and being in the same session.• Added more Information in case of a function error.• You can now choose not to submit an entry.• Removed debug function to recalculate Entries.txt as the feature is deprecated and no longer functional (and could potentially break your Settings.txt).• Manual update menus now tell you why you see them.• Fixed bug that would cause word count related achievements not to be announced when gained.• Added 4 new beginner-related achievements, which are easy to get and introduce users to the various types of badges. If you have been using Blind Diary for any significant amount of time, you'll likely receive these achievements immediately (check them after submitting an entry or via the menu).• Minor improvementsLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackCách Schneider thúc đẩy sự tiến bộ trong năng lượng sạchSchneiderElectric, một tên tuổi uy tín trong lĩnh vực công nghệ và quản lý năng lượng, đang đóng vai trò quan trọng trong sự chuyển đổi toàn cầu đến năng lượng sạch và bền vững. Hãy cùng AME Group khám phá những đóng góp đáng kể của họ cho tương lai xanh của hành tinh.I. Giới thiệu Schneider và vai trò của họ trong lĩnh vực năng lượng sạchSchneider Electric, một tập đoàn công nghệ quốc tế, đã xác định rõ mục tiêu của mình trong việc đóng góp vào cuộc cách mạng năng lượng sạch toàn cầu. Họ không chỉ đứng đầu trong ngành công nghiệp công nghệ và quản lý năng lượng, mà còn đang đi đầu trong việc thúc đẩy sự chuyển đổi đối với năng lượng sạch và bền vững.Tập đoàn này đóng một vai trò quan trọng trong việc đẩy mạnh đầu tư vào nghiên cứu và phát triển công nghệ tiên tiến. Schneider Electric không ngừng tìm kiếm các giải pháp tiết kiệm năng lượng và tăng cường hiệu suất sử dụng năng lượng. Nhờ vào những nỗ lực này, họ đã giúp các doanh nghiệp trên khắp thế giới giảm thiểu mức tiêu thụ năng lượng không cần thiết và tối ưu hóa quá trình sản xuất.Không chỉ dừng lại ở đó, Schneider Electric còn áp dụng trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) và trí tuệ cảm xúc (EI) trong quản lý năng lượng. Kết hợp hai khía cạnh này đã mang lại một bước đột phá trong việc dự đoán và tối ưu hóa sử dụng năng lượng, cũng như cải thiện trải nghiệm người dùng trong tòa nhà thông minh và các hệ thống quản lý năng lượng.Electric cũng chú trọng vào việc phát triển giải pháp thông minh cho quản lý lưới điện. Điều này giúp tối ưu hóa việc cung cấp năng lượng, giảm nguy cơ cắt điện và thúc đẩy sử dụng nguồn năng lượng tái tạo, là một bước quan trọng trong việc đảm bảo năng lượng bền vững cho tương lai.Nhưng Schneider Electric không chỉ tập trung vào hiệu suất năng lượng. Họ còn đóng góp vào việc xây dựng hệ thống thông tin năng lượng thông qua sự kết hợp của công nghệ IoT (Internet of Things). Các công cụ giám sát năng lượng dựa trên IoT cho phép họ thu thập dữ liệu thời gian thực từ các thiết bị và hệ thống năng lượng, giúp quản lý và tối ưu hóa hiệu suất một cách hiệu quả.Tìm hiểu thêm trong bài viết khác tại:https://www.are.na/block/23486806II. Đổi mới công nghệA. Đầu tư nghiên cứu và phát triển công nghệ tiên tiếnElectric đã không ngừng đầu tư vào nghiên cứu và phát triển công nghệ tiên tiến để nâng cao hiệu suất và tích hợp năng lượng sạch vào các giải pháp của họ. Qua việc tập trung vào việc tạo ra các thiết bị và hệ thống tiết kiệm năng lượng và hiệu suất cao, họ đã giúp cho các doanh nghiệp và tổ chức giảm thiểu tiêu thụ năng lượng không cần thiết và thúc đẩy sử dụng năng lượng tái tạo.B. Áp dụng trí tuệ nhân tạo và trí tuệ cảm xúc trong quản lý năng lượngElectric đã đánh bại biên độ bằng việc áp dụng trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) và trí tuệ cảm xúc (EI) trong quản lý năng lượng. AI được sử dụng để dự đoán và tối ưu hóa sử dụng năng lượng, đảm bảo rằng các hệ thống luôn hoạt động với hiệu suất tối ưu. Trong khi đó, EI giúp tạo ra trải nghiệm người dùng tốt hơn và tối ưu hóa quản lý năng lượng trong các tòa nhà thông minh và các hệ thống công nghiệp.C. Phát triển giải pháp thông minh cho quản lý lưới điệnElectric cũng đã dành sự quan tâm đặc biệt cho việc phát triển giải pháp thông minh cho quản lý lưới điện. Điều này bao gồm việc sử dụng công nghệ IoT (Internet of Things) để giám sát và điều khiển lưới điện một cách hiệu quả hơn. Nhờ vào những hệ thống này, họ đã giảm nguy cơ cắt điện, tối ưu hóa việc cung cấp năng lượng, và thúc đẩy sử dụng nguồn năng lượng tái tạo.III. Tăng cường hiệu suất năng lượngA. Tối ưu hóa quản lý năng lượng trong các ngành công nghiệpElectric cung cấp giải pháp tùy chỉnh cho nhiều ngành công nghiệp, từ sản xuất đến dịch vụ và tòa nhà. Họ giúp các doanh nghiệp tối ưu hóa quản lý năng lượng, giảm thất thoát và tăng hiệu suất sản xuất.B. Giải pháp tiết kiệm năng lượngBằng cách kết hợp tự động hóa và quản lý dữ liệu, Schneider Electric giúp doanh nghiệp tìm ra các cơ hội tiết kiệm năng lượng tiềm năng và thực hiện chúng một cách hiệu quả.C. Khuyến khích sử dụng nguồn điện tái tạo và lưu trữ năng lượngElectric khuyến khích sử dụng nguồn điện tái tạo bằng cách cung cấp các giải pháp tích hợp cho năng lượng mặt trời và gió. Họ cũng đang phát triển giải pháp lưu trữ năng lượng để giảm tải lưới điện và tạo sự linh hoạt trong quản lý năng lượng.V. Cam kết bảo vệ môi trường và phát triển bền vữngA. Áp dụng tiêu chuẩn nghiêm ngặt về môi trườngElectric cam kết tuân thủ tiêu chuẩn nghiêm ngặt về bảo vệ môi trường trong quá trình sản xuất và hoạt động kinh doanh của họ.
