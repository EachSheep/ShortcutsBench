- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut actually works!!! I’ve tried so many different shortcuts and no one has got it right until now.Download HD videos and/or just the Audio from any YouTube link.You can also listen to your saved audio/songs in the VLC app or right inside the Shortcuts app. Even plays in the background.Enjoy!!!!2.0 - Jan. 24, 2019, 10:20 a.m.Revamped most of the code so that now you can download protected content from YouTube. It might take a few more seconds than before but it’s due to the more lines of code to get around YouTube’s protection.Also you will need to signup on www.rapidapi.com and get a FREE API KEY to download the protected videos/music.You will be prompted to set that api key up upon first run and you will never be bothered with it again.Another thing I forgot to mention is you can listen to all your downloaded songs from within this shortcut or you can open them up in VLC from within this shortcut if you have the app installed.Enjoy!!!Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

Then:Enjoy the songs in your favourite audio player. My favourite on iOS isFlacboxSome m4a files downloaded from Youtube have a DASH header (with an empty seek table) instead of a standard mp4 header. The DASH format is not supported by many audio players, so this usually causes the m4a file to have wrong duration and to sound silent for half of the time. This has been solved in Music Grabber version 1.1.1 or greater. But if you have already downloaded m4a files with this issue in the past, you can use my small shortcutFixup DASH m4a headersto easily fix them.This shortcut was inspired byMusic Downloader(author: @creepyeyesOO).1.5.6 - April 17, 2023, 7:41 a.m.- fixed crash with dash namesLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

If you follow this guide precisely, WeatherWalls will work like a charm on your device.RequirementsAllow 'Untrusted Shortcuts' on your device by going to Settings → Shortcuts.The shortcut is only working on iPhone models running iOS 14.3 or higher as the 'Set Wallpaper' action was (re)introduced in this version.SetupBefore WeatherWalls can work, we need to make sure all images are in the correct folders.Get everything set upOn your iPhone, click on the link below for the installer shortcut. Run it to download and extract all files. Once completed, you can delete the installer shortcut again.Installer ShortcutClick on the link below to install the most recent version of WeatherWallsShortcutWeatherWalls does not update your wallpaper automatically by default. You can either choose to manually trigger this shortcut every time you want your wallpaper to update OR you can choose to use automations to trigger the shortcut.Create your own automations to your preferences and add a 'Run Shortcut' action. Choose the WeatherWalls Shortcut to run and you're set.Recommended is to run WeatherWalls approximately every 1-2 hours and maybe more frequent around the sunrise/sunset period to fully enjoy the effect. Alternatively you can choose to run the shortcut every time you open/close one of your most used apps (also through Automations) to make sure your wallpaper is updated from time to time.IMPORTANT NOTE Running this shortcut too frequently through some automations (e.g. Every time I open app, run shortcut) can have a negative impact on the battery life of your device. It is suggested to use the feature to limit the shortcut to only run once every 10-15 minutes at least.Find more infoson Github3.2.2 - Aug. 22, 2021, 12:01 p.m.- bugfixesLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedback[UPDATE] I have long discontinued the backened that allowed the shortcut to return the desired results. It costed me money for no return at all but it was great while it lasted. For that reason, if you found it particularly helpful and would like to host the server yourself you can download a copy of it (I open sourced it a while back) and run it on your computer or a Raspberry Pi. GitHub:https://github.com/mawesome4ever/SearchYT-ServerThe shortcut first makes sure you are running the current version of the shortcut to prevent you from requesting something from the server that might have potentially been changed.Then, it asks what you would like to search on youtube and if it is a channel or not. It then sends this data to my personally hosted server that web scrapes Youtube for the title and links and it returns them as a dictionary to be used in the Shortcut.After that, it asks which one would you like to watch which would send your word "number" to my server so it can translate it to an actual number to be used to get the url from the dictionary received earlier.Finally, it goes through the dictionary to check if it finds a match from the numbered dictionary which contains the title and then gets the url from the url dictionary which uses the title as the key to then open the url in safari or the youtube app.2.02 - Nov. 6, 2018, 7:07 p.m.Fixed a url issue which prevented users from contacting the server with their query, added a bug report where if the server returns no data, the user will be able to send a report that allows me to reconstruct what caused it to send nothing (it should always send back videos)Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackDownloads mp3 songs from YouTube using Spotify metadata1) Enter the album name
2) The shortcut shows the songs in the album
3) Enter the numbers of the songs you want to download (Example : 1,2,3,5) - Maximum 5 songs at a time
4) Wait for the shortcut to complete its process
5) Then it will prompt to save the mp3 on your iPhone
6) Save it to the VLC folder on your iPhone to play the songs in VLC (You can use other music players too)Working of the shortcut Explained:This shortcut is powered by Spotify's API, song.link 's API, Amazon Web Services Cloud (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway).
The shortcut starts by asking for the album name. If the album is found on Spotify it proceeds or if not found shows 'album not found' and the shortcut stops. Shortcuts calls the API for the 1st Lambda function which returns the Spotify Album ID and the song list to shortcuts. Shortcuts then shows the song list and asks the user to input the songs to download. Shortcuts take this input and album ID to call the API for 2nd lambda function. The second lambda function assigns a process-id, calls a 3rd lambda function (no api call needed for 3rd func because it is called by the 2nd function) and returns a p-id to shortcuts. Then shortcuts waits for the 3rd lambda function to complete downloading and the songs depending on the number of songs requested. Shortcuts then calls the 3rd function with p-id to get the links of the S3 urls of the songs. The function returns the links to shortcuts. Shortcuts uses those links to download the songs using the urls and saves it to your iPhone.1.0 - Feb. 25, 2021, 1:36 p.m.-Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionNote: This Shortcut works between Dec 1st and Dec 25th only.The Advent Calendar shortcut is full of more or less funny and partly interactive elements. It has around 160 actions.This is not a shortcut simply showing you some alert each day. There’s even more…!HoHoHoAll graphics on this page were made with MediaKitLatest Release NotesFeedbackAttention: In order for the shortcut to work completely offline, the entire content was saved locally. This means that the shortcut has a file size of more than 16 MB, which can take up so much memory on your iOS device that your Shortcuts app could crash. It is recommended to make a backup first. Do not use the shortcut as a widget in Today View and never open it in edit mode (cause the shortcut needs even more memory in edit mode/when you try to edit something)! This is even more likely to crash your Shortcuts app/database. Another thing: As you might already know, with the release of iOS 13 you have to scroll through all actions before adding a shortcut. Please be really patient with this shortcut when scrolling, because the huge file size slows down scrolling. Overall it is recommended to use the shortcut only with newer devices. During the adjustment of the shortcut to iOS 13 I had only one database crash. After closing and reopening the app all shortcuts were back. As I said, it's just a question of memory. I have imported and tested the shortcut several times on a test device. The Shortcuts app did not crash once. Use at your own risk!But I don’t wanna tell you too much what’s inside, cause it wouldn’t be a surprise anymore. I hope you all have fun with it and I’m wishing you all a festive Christmas season!PS: Please don’t take this too seriously. And don't expect miracles. I just wanted to create something special for the Christmas Season to put a little smile on your face. You might have seen parts of the calendar before and somewhere else. And there might be things that you don’t like. I’ve tried to make it honest, politically correct, innocent, cordial, funny and hopefully not boring. I’ve had many more unique ideas, but couldn’t implement those due to limitations (database and shortcut crashed many times during experimenting). Some surprises you might already know in a different way or look, but I gave them a Christmas theme/look. I apologize for any inconvenience. ;)This Shortcut is available exclusively on RoutineHub.co. If you find it somewhere else, it's a fake. Please let me know in the comments below if you found this Shortcut somewhere else.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis istheJarvis shortcut. (Co-created with u/Bep13)This is version 1.0.1, and for right now, it just supports the weather. Look forward to future updates with other functions, both from me and other creators.Jarvis is actually not just one shortcut. When you first run it, or run after an update, it will prompt you to install any new shortcuts connected to Jarvis. Why separate shortcuts? So you can trigger any function of Jarvis from Siri with just one command. You can trigger Siri and say “Jarvis, how’s the weather?” And Jarvis will respond. Or, if you trigger the main Jarvis shortcut, you can use natural language to get the same results — so you could also ask “is it going to rain?”, “does it look like it’ll be hot out?” or virtually any phrase you’d say to a person when asking about the weather, and Jarvis will understand.And if you have your own functions for Jarvis, you can have them added to this shortcut via your routinehub link — you still have full control, can issue updates yourself, and your downloads on routinehub will show up under your shortcut, and your name. Just email me at[email protected]to get the process started, as there are a few guidelines for shortcut behavior that need to be met in order to be included.1.1 - Jan. 18, 2021, midnightVersion 1.1 introduces “Jarvis, turn on Do Not Disturb”.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

Enter how many sound clips you will be using then select the photo, then appropriate sound clip for each one. Then add the soundboard to your home screen.Not quite sure what the limits will be with this, so don't go mad for a 50 clip board all at once.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackI am not listing toolbox pro as a requirement for the shortcut. However if you have the paid version you can use the search feature to narrow your results before you see the choose menu and greatly reduce the time it takes.If I can find a way to do the same without the app I will but for now this is how it is.The shortcut will do three things as of now (but plans for future options are already being worked on).• Filter will show you the Shot & Melee Attack of the units and it end as well as the armor values. These are preconfigured and slow but you can change them or add your own if you wish. I plan to make it modular in the near future.• Search will ask for a word to search against and show you only what matches. It's by far the fastest option but requires Tool Box Pro. For now this is the only way I know to accomplish this but I am working on it. However the app is well worth the money.• Full List shows you ALL the items in the database. It can be slow and sometimes it's oddly super fast. If you want to search without tool box this is your option. Run it then search in the search field up top.Once you have selected your choice it will show you the stats.Future plans...• Multi part select to create a grid of images.
• Modular menu driven filtering options

If you activate this shortcut directly, the text it displays after Jarvis speaks will not be shown unless you’re running this shortcut from Jarvis 1.0.2 or later. If you run it directly, it won’t show the text.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackHere it is, a long waiting time before releasing. I originally called the shortcut flash, but is now flashy. You can now get it here.
This shortcut is a very weird and strange shortcut. It makes the flashlight flash on and off as it was a fire alarm strobe or something. It repeats that for about 400 or something times. It also says the appearance from light to dark.
Guess what? This action repeats about 5056 times! That's right, it actually does happen. After that, it makes your brightness go down from 0% to 100%. It won't do it that much. It could also be used as a hand warmer because sometimes the device to make it warm. Also, sometimes it makes the device go slow when running XD.
On a sidenote, you should run this using a full battery, or enough battery. The shortcut could decrease battery life. So if you like to watch your device do random stuff, this is one of the things you must get. you could even probably use this as a prank if you wanted. Watch as the fun starts. This could also be an experiment to see how devices react to all these changes and also repeating the same settings.
Update: as of iOS 16, apple has remove the flashlight function in Shortcuts, therefore, the shortcut will not work for devices running iOS 16. Be sure you are running iOS 15 or older to run it. I don't even know why it was removed in the first place. Typical Apple.1.2 - Oct. 18, 2020, 3:08 p.m.What's new, changed how many times the flashlight turns on and off. This will repeat 1,105 times.The shortcut will now turn on and off LED flash. This will repeat 384 times.Set appearance action has been updated. It will now repeat for 7,701 times.Happy flashing!Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

Each player starts with 3 chips, or nickles, quarters, etc. If the die show Left, Left, Keep, then the player must give 2 of his chips to the person on his left, and Keep one for himself. Players will only roll the number of dice that corresponds to the number of chips they have so if a player only has one chip, he only rolls one die. The game continues until one person remains and has collected all the chips. Players on occasion may get put out of the game by the roll of the dice but may re-enter if a player on either side is forced to give them one or more of their chips.1.0 - Feb. 14, 2019, 2:18 p.m.Initial versionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut lets you play a number guessing game. First, it asks for your input method. You can either use voice input or just use the keyboard. Note that it will automatically choose keyboard input if you are not connected to the internet.
Then you get to choose the difficulty. The Ultimate Number Guessing Game features 3 difficulties, which include easy (1 ~ 10), Hard (1 ~ 1000), and Entertainment (1 ~ almost infinity). Each has corresponding chances.Next, you guess what you think the random number is. It will hint you whether your guess is higher or lower than the number.The rules are just as normal: you guess the number within the given chances, you win. Otherwise, you lose. This shortcut is equipped with advanced programming, so it tells you how many times you've guessed if you win, and how many numbers were close to the answer if you lose. This shortcut also has plural detection, which means you will not see the (s) with annoying parentheses sticking behind every word. This shortcut is function based.This shortcut has UpdateKit integrated, so users can get the latest updates whenever the developer pushes them.Graphics made withMediaKit.1.6.5 - Sept. 22, 2019, 9:25 p.m.- Shortcut is function based.- Optimized for iOS 13, kept the original blank when entering a guess with keyboard, since it automatically fills with a 0 as default if you leave it blank when making the shortcut in iOS 13.- Changed “guess a number” to “guess an integer” in the game rule.- Added a function where it can detect whether you entered anything using dictation, as well as if you entered a number or something else.- Optimized for UpdateKit 6.0. Now auto-quits the shortcut after installing the new version functions just as before.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

I tried to make it as clean as possible and commented on steps to add other networks in which are also listed below. Thanks to /u/Matthewr_1987 and /u/Mralexhay for the help and support in figuring out this dictionary stuff. The shortcut does rely on Toolbox Pro’s free actions Create Menu Item and Sort List, so download below.You will have to go into the shortcut and select your Apple TV on the Open App on Apple TV actionsTo get the icon for any networks you want to add, download and run the below shortcut. Search for the app, select the one you want and it will save the image, base64 encode it and copy the info to the clipboard. Paste it into the dictionary explained below.AppStore icon Base64To add a new Network/App, hit the green + and add a new Dictionary to the bottom of the Dictionary below. For the Key, add the name of the Network/App name. Tap where it says 0 items and add a Text field. For the key, label it icon. For the value, paste the Base64 text copied to the clipboard. Add a second text field if service requires activation, label it activate and add the url to the networks activation link.DictionaryTo add another network/app to the list, scroll down to the very last Otherwise tab that you see below within the IF statements. Right below it, add another IF statement. Tap where it says Chosen Item, scroll down and select name. Tap Condition and select "contains". Then input the name of the network/app and add a Open App on Apple TV action, choose your app and Apple TV.Finding last otherwiseDrag the Show Webpage action right below the newly created Otherwise tab made from the IF statement we just added from the above comment.I tried to avoid all the IF statements but shortcuts would draw up an error anytime I tried to use the Ask Each Time option on the Open App On Apple TV action and theres no way to pass a variable to the action to select a specific Apple TV or App.And yes, this can all be simplified with just two actions, Wake Apple TV and Open App on Apple TV but I really like the menu option and display of only my favorite apps.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackA scrolling map survival gameLostis a relatively low action shortcut (~100) for a game and is fast-running. Unlike most shortcut map games,Lostuses a combination of shortcuts, to display the data and JavaScript, to manipulate the data. These two coding languages come together to make a fast and reliable shortcut game. This is also the first shortcut to introduce a scrolling map instead of a fixed map for a game.The goal of the game is simple; survive as long as possible. The length of time you survive is marked in days. Each day consists of 4 actions. You use an action whenever you move or do other actions like fishing.You will start the game at a random spot on the map with 15 health, 2 food, and 4 actions. After each day you will have to eat a food. If you don't have any you lose 3 health.To find food you will have to find berries (🫐), find rabbits (🐇), or fish.The map will scroll with each movement. You will always be able to see 4 tiles on all sides of you, creating a 9x9 grid. The map is 30x30 and includes 900 tiles. Around the map, you will find ⬛️. ⬛️ are the walls of the map and you will not be able to pass them.1.2.1 - Oct. 28, 2021, 1:12 a.m.- iOS15.1 supportLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackHOT: In the recent iOS 17.1 update, browsers (including Brave) can now play YouTube videos in up to 4K resolution, a significant improvement from the previous HD limit. This shortcut uses the Brave browser so now you can watch video Full HD / 4K just like the YouTube app, and play the music/sound of the video in the background if you want.GUIDE TO INSTALLStep 1: install Brave browser: https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/brave-private-web-browser/id1052879175Step 2: open Brave’s Setting and toggle on the option “Enable Background Audio”. If you don’t know how to do it, here is a guide video: https://youtube.com/shorts/8F2lTSfAM54?feature=shareStep 3: open Brave, go to the YouTube website ( https://www.youtube.com/ ), and then log in to your account. You don’t have to change this website to desktop mode, just let it stay in mobile mode so that the content you see remains big & clear.Step 4: After you download this shortcut, add this shortcut to your home screen. Done.After that, you can just touch the blue Youtube icon named “Youtube Vanced” on your screen to watch videos normally or listen to audio in the background by turning off the screen or swiping up to exit the app. Another amazing thing is you can copy the text of Youtube comments (one letter, one word, one sentence, or the entire comment) just like you can do on a desktop website.RESULT (background playing & copying the text of comments): https://youtube.com/shorts/ievm7sXZ41g?feature=shareTell me if you have any problems.
Thank you for reading..Introduction / confession (no need to read):Back in the days when I was an Android user, I could listen to YouTube videos in the background quickly & conveniently. In Android, I just click the Youtube Vanced icon on the home screen, play a video, turn off the screen, and I am still able to listen to the audio of this video in the background. The Android’s YouTube Vanced allows me to log in with my Google account so that I can quickly watch my favorite kinds of YouTube content. Meanwhile, the app Pure Tuber on iOS doesn’t support logging in, and therefore you cannot view your watching history. Using Safari to listen to videos in the background requires you to turn the website to Desktop mode (which makes the content smaller and harder to see), then you turn off the screen while watching a video, you have to turn on it again to click the play button in the lock screen to play the audio of this video under background. The inconvenience is similar if you use the control center method with Safari, swipe up and swipe down, blah, blah... Therefore, I tried to find other ways to replace YouTube Vanced by using the Shortcuts app. I have tested many shortcuts to play videos in the background. Some of them failed or no longer supported the newer version of iOS. Some of them are successful but they require some steps which take time to listen to the video (click the share button, then click “more”, then choose the shortcut, then wait for it to process the video, then finally you can be able to play it in the background - not so convenient, right?).Today I introduce my solution to listen to YouTube in the background conveniently. You have to set up it once and for all. It takes some steps but you only have to do them one time, all the time later you can listen to YouTube in the background quickly & conveniently.*I am not so confident about what I am going to say but I think Brave can block ads as well as YouTube Vanced. I watched so many videos and not a single video has ads. I think it is because Brave is a browser specialized in blocking ads. I have tested many videos that have ads on the Youtube app and I put each of them on the Brave YouTube mobile website. Strangely, none of them has ads. I don’t know why. I think Brave Ads blocking ability is not that strong but maybe I underestimated it. This is the most recent video I have tested. You can test for yourself: https://youtu.be/7hrQTiJngps1.0 - Nov. 8, 2022, 11:09 p.m.This is the first version of this shortcut.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackPlayMastermind, the classic game of codemaker vs. codebreaker, in Shortcuts.You can choose whether Siri or a human opponent is the codemaker. The code is made of four digits between 1 and 6. (Decide in advance whether repeated digits are allowed.)The codebreaker then has ten chances to guess the code correctly. After each attempt, feedback is generated automatically by the shortcut to give the codebreaker some clues:The order of the dots does not correspond to their positions in the code, however. The codebreaker must take the number of dots of each color and make an educated guess as to which dot corresponds to each position in the code.If you guess the code correctly, you win! If not, then after ten attempts, you lose, and you will be able to see the correct code.Made incollaborationwith@robric18.1.1 - June 28, 2021, 3:25 a.m.Disable decimals and negative numbers when prompting the user to enter a code.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackTypically, copying a link through the Share button on the TikTok iOS app creates an expirable link, which breaks after around four months.The only workaround is to use this expirable link on a browser, wait for the page to load, and then to copy the new link from the address bar.This shortcut, however, works around this limitation and allows you to conveniently copy the unexpirable link on the iOS Share Sheet (the rightmost "More" button on the TikTok share screen)This is especially useful if you save TikToks by their links somewhere else, such as a Google Doc, and intend to come back to them later.If you want to share instead of copying to your clipboard, simply change the last step in the shortcut.2.2 - Feb. 7, 2024, 5:51 a.m.Undo ? decisionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackYahtzee is a classic dice game that uses five 6-sided dice. It’s easy to learn, quick to play, and it is fun and engaging entertainment. There’s a reason it’s been so popular for decades!Unlike normal Yahtzee, this is in shortcuts. This changes some small details. Firstly, you can play anytime with only your phone or device and without scoresheets or dice. Secondly, this Shortcut is one player only. Yahtzee can usually be played one or more players. You can mimic multiplayer by each player playing separately then comparing your scores.The object of Yahtzee is for each player to roll dice to accumulate points over the course of a series of rounds, trying to obtain the best rolls they can in 13 different categories. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins (or playing by yourself, try to beat your high score).1.10 - Aug. 19, 2021, 5:09 p.m.- Shareable Yahtzee Scorecard- “Best Experienced In Dark Mode“ on first menuLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

You can either choose to watch the microwave or hear the microwave, but there’s a little surprise at the end!When the shortcut finishes playing the microwave, it will ask you if you would like to exit the shortcut— but there’s a catch. Upon clicking “Yes”, the shortcut will flashbang you by playing the CSGO flashbang sound effect and turn your brightness up all the way while enabling light mode. After that, the shortcut will begin to spam you with notifications and then (safely!) freeze and crash your device (respring).This shortcut would be a great prank for you friends!

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackINTRODUCTION (no need to read, you can jump to the "GUIDE TO INSTALL" below):The new "YouTube ReVanced" shortcut is an alternative version of my old shortcut "YouTube Vanced" which was released 1 year ago. The new shortcut retains the feature of playing YouTube audio in the background. I created this shortcut a week ago but hesitated to share it since it is just the same as the old one. However, with the recent iOS 17.1 update, browsers can now play YouTube videos in up to 4K resolution, a significant improvement from the previous 720p HD limit. Given this enhancement, I decided to introduce this new shortcut. Both shortcuts (new and old) now support background audio with Full HD/4K video playback.GUIDE TO INSTALLStep 1: Install the Video Lite app from the App Store:https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/video-lite/id1598997500Step 2: run this shortcut, you will see the Youtube website be opened. Then log in to your YouTube/Google account.Step 3: add this shortcut to your home screen. Done.After that, you can just touch the purple YouTube icon named “ReVanced” on your screen to watch videos normally or listen to audio in the background by turning off the screen or swiping up to exit the app.Advertisement:The new shortcut “ReVanced” has better UI, but the old "Youtube Vanced" shortcut can do the same functions and even allows you to copy the text of YouTube comments (one letter, one word, one sentence, or the entire comment) just like you can do on a desktop website. Copying text is something this new shortcut and the original YouTube app cannot do. So if you want, check out the old shortcut here:

You can reuse the same API key in all of your shortcuts, but it is HIGHLY inadvisable to share this key with anyone (hence why you don’t have mine)Essentially, it’s all the same shortcut, with different pre-generated responses that will alter how your responses work, making Siri just a bit more useful and fun.Content warning: due to use of the DaVinci model of OpenAI’s text generation algorithm, mature content can be created, but generally only when it is explicitly asked for.2.0 - March 17, 2023, 4:53 a.m.Added an option to obtain an API key if you don’t have one yet.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackDisney+is the exclusive home for streaming all Episodes ofGolden Girls. There are all 7 seasons available in Germany (and some other countries except US). Unfortunately Disney+ forgot to offer a random episode option.That's why I built this shortcut which chooses a random Golden Girls episode and plays it either on your iOS device or even on your AppleTV.Upon installation the shortcut also asks for your desired target device where you want to watch. Besides watching on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch it's possible to choose yourApple TVhere as well! In this case your iOS device will AirPlay the episode to your Apple TV automatically.Of course you can change your output later by editing the Shortcut. You can also build an automation, e.g. NFC-triggered which just runs this shortcut. You can also use a Siri phrase to run it. Since iOS 13 Siri is using the name of the shortcut for that. So you could rename it and say: „Hey Siri, what‘s going on in St. Olaf“? Siri will read the chosen episode.Preconditions:You need an activeDisney+ subscriptionand an iOS device with theDisney+ iOS appinstalled. If you want to use an Apple TV please make sure to install the Disney+ app there as well.The output is in german (for now). There will be an english one in a few weeks.Preview:1.0.0 - Sept. 15, 2021, 10:02 a.m.initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackTitin is a huge protein, over 1nm in size. Titin is important in the contraction of striated muscle tissues. It connects the Z line to the M line in the sarcomere. The protein contributes to force transmission at the Z line and resting tension in the I band region.[10] It limits the range of motion of the sarcomere in tension, thus contributing to the passive stiffness of muscle. Variations in the sequence of titin between different types of muscle (e.g., cardiac or skeletal) have been correlated with differences in the mechanical properties of these muscles.[5][11](Source: Wikipedia)It is also the longest word, at 189,819 letters.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackVersion 2 MAJOR UPDATE THANKS TO Björn Hilbert who completely re wrote the shortcut adding a splash screen to add your API key and your name as well as he added contextual conversation. V1 gave miss ques, dropped prompts, now every chat seems smooth. A valid API key from openAI is needed.
a single response use (not contextual) on average 200 tokens. 1000 tokens cost 2c
This shortcut was originally adapted from @MateMarschalko shortcut for home automation. When I saw how it worked I knew it could re imagined into Siri~mate . I edited ,deleted and changed it's purpose from a home automation shortcut to a fun addition to siri.
THIS DOES NOT REPLACE SIRI FOR ON DEVICE PROMPS AND REMINDERS. IT CANT OPEN APPS.After downloading install your API key when prompted, as well as your username or how you want to be addressed by your personality aissistant.The text box that contains the instructions for chatgpt to who the personality is can be edited but be careful when editing one word, or the order will get notable changes in reply's. I found less is better. Each one took awhile testing personality directions and tweaking it to get a constant flow. Not to say you wont get gibberish, wrong answers, you will. it's not perfect.
Check out all the personalities!It's really fun , the responses are not canned Asking general trivia questions or going into the detail of the personalities character chatGPT delivers the response in the style and cadence of the personality. ChatGPT is amazing!, this is what personal assistants should be.
download them all, you’ll never be happier with multiple personalities. Easily pull up a new aissistant by just asking ! Please leave some feedback! or personalities you would like to see and we can see if it works. Not all ideas work, the personality has to be those larger than life animated personalities that have catch phrases or a way of speaking that is what defines them.2.0.2 - Jan. 29, 2023, 12:45 a.m.added a natural question response for the personality.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

But, sadly, i recently foundnout that the localStorage method doesnt work without either Koder’s javascript ide or a web browser, so saving data isnt in right now. I may be able to find something i can do to convert the data from the javascript variables to shortcut variables, and then save it as a JSON file, but i don’t know how to do the variable conversion bit.

It works for all apps that support a share sheet, but if an app doesn’t, you can set up a voice command or have the thumbnail in a convenient place to use this.Discord users @rocky5 and @elroysgame spent a couple hours working out the kinks in this shortcut.1.0 - April 19, 2022, 4:50 a.m.None, it’s the first versionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackVersion 2 MAJOR UPDATE THANKS TO Björn Hilbert who completely re wrote the shortcut adding a splash screen to add your API key and your name as well as he added contextual conversation. V1 gave miss ques, dropped prompts, now every chat seems smooth. A valid API key from openAI is needed. a single response use (not contextual) on average 200 tokens. 1000 tokens cost 2c This shortcut was originally adapted from @MateMarschalko shortcut for home automation. When I saw how it worked I knew it could re imagined into Siri~mate . I edited ,deleted and changed it's purpose from a home automation shortcut to a fun addition to siri. THIS DOES NOT REPLACE SIRI FOR ON DEVICE PROMPS AND REMINDERS. IT CANT OPEN APPS.
After downloading install your API key when prompted, as well as your username or how you want to be addressed by your personality aissistant.The text box that contains the instructions for chatgpt to who the personality is can be edited but be careful when editing one word, or the order will get notable changes in reply's. I found less is better. Each one took awhile testing personality directions and tweaking it to get a constant flow. Not to say you wont get gibberish, wrong answers, you will. it's not perfect. Check out all the personalities!It's really fun , the responses are not canned Asking general trivia questions or going into the detail of the personalities character chatGPT delivers the response in the style and cadence of the personality. ChatGPT is amazing!, this is what personal assistants should be. download them all, you’ll never be happier with multiple personalities. Easily pull up a new aissistant by just asking ! Please leave some feedback! or personalities you would like to see and we can see if it works. Not all ideas work, the personality has to be those larger than life animated personalities that have catch phrases or a way of speaking that is what defines them.2.0.2 - Jan. 29, 2023, 12:44 a.m.added natural response question for personality.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

V1 gave miss ques, dropped prompts, now every chat seems smooth. A valid API key from openAI is needed. a single response use (not contextual) on average 200 tokens. 1000 tokens cost 2c This shortcut was originally adapted from @MateMarschalko shortcut for home automation. When I saw how it worked I knew it could re imagined into Siri~mate . I edited ,deleted and changed it's purpose from a home automation shortcut to a fun addition to siri. THIS DOES NOT REPLACE SIRI FOR ON DEVICE PROMPS AND REMINDERS. IT CANT OPEN APPS. After downloading install your API key when prompted, as well as your username or how you want to be addressed by your personality aissistant.The text box that contains the instructions for chatgpt to who the personality is can be edited but be careful when editing one word, or the order will get notable changes in reply's. I found less is better. Each one took awhile testing personality directions and tweaking it to get a constant flow. Not to say you wont get gibberish, wrong answers, you will. it's not perfect. Check out all the personalities!It's really fun , the responses are not canned Asking general trivia questions or going into the detail of the personalities character chatGPT delivers the response in the style and cadence of the personality. ChatGPT is amazing!, this is what personal assistants should be. download them all, you’ll never be happier with multiple personalities. Easily pull up a new aissistant by just asking ! Please leave some feedback! or personalities you would like to see and we can see if it works.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackINTRODUCTIONSince the Files app on iOS as well as most media players doesn’t show you the total duration of multiple selected songs, I made this shortcut to help iOS users to solve such a shortcoming. The shortcut will show you how many audio files are selected, the duration of each audio file, and the total duration of these audio files (in the format “hours : minutes: seconds” ).HOW TO USESelect multiple audio files.Choose “share”Choose this shortcut “Total duration of multiple songs” in the share sheet.Background information (no need to read): Some iOS users and Shortcuts community members asked for help in viewing the total duration of multiple audio files, similar to what can be done on Android or Windows. They were advised to download a specific music app (whose name I don't remember) and manually import the audio files into the app. Then they had to add the songs (audio files) into the same playlist, and the app would display the duration of the playlist as the total duration of these audio files. As you can see, it took a significant amount of time and effort to achieve such a small task. My shortcut makes this process much easier.1.11 - April 27, 2023, 4:05 p.m.1.11.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackEver wanted an over-complicated iMessage spammer?Requires libM16A1:https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12016/M16A1 is an iMessage spammer with functions based off of operating an M16A1. It has features such as a firemode selector switch, bolt catch, and forward assist.Operating the shortcut is analogous to operating an M16A1. Each time you have the option to manipulate features of the shortcut (pull charging handle, etc.), you will be presented with an image of an M16A1 in its current state, then a list of functions to choose from. More on that later.To "load" the shortcut, have a text file with the text you want to spam. The shortcut will split apart the text word by word and send each one as a separate message to your target phone number.If gaming or other experiences have trained you to use an M16A1, feel free to try out the functions by yourself. You can "load" the shortcut by selecting a text file after using theLoad Magazineoption. If you want to learn how to use the shortcut, read on. There is an example at the bottom of the description.Pull Trigger:Analogous to pulling the trigger of an M16A1. If your selector lever is set to semi or auto and you have a text file "chambered", then this will send the message to your target.Pull Charging Handle Back:Analogous to pulling the charging handle of an M16A1 back. In real life, this chambers a round from the magazine. In the shortcut, this "chambers" the first word in your text file, which makes it ready to send.However, if the M16A1 is already chambered (bolt closed), then pulling the charging handle will eject the round currently in the chamber. Similarly, if the shortcut is already "chambered", then pulling the charging handle will skip the currently "chambered" word and move on to the next one.Depress Bolt Catch:Analogous to pushing the bolt catch button on an M16A1. In real life, pressing the bolt catch on an open bolt will close it, simultaneously chambering a round if there is a magazine loaded. In the shortcut, this is used to close an open bolt, which also "chambers" a word. Pressing the bolt catch on a closed bolt does nothing.Push Forward Assist:Does the same thing as the bolt catch.Move Selector Lever:Analogous to moving the selector lever of an M16A1. The M16A1 features:SafeSemi (Semi Automatic)Auto (Fully Automatic)Semi auto is when you pull the trigger once, and one round is fired. Full auto is when you hold down the trigger, and multiple rounds are fired in succession.In the shortcut, "semi" will send one message per trigger pull, and "auto" will send all the words in your text file.Keep in mind the selector lever's default is in the "safe" position. You need to change it to send messages.Load Magazine:Analogous to loading a magazine into an M16A1. Magazines are where rounds are stored and for the shortcut, it is where the words are stored. Loading the magazine in this shortcut involves selecting a text file. The shortcut then reads the text file and splits it by word. These words are analogous to individual rounds, and can be sent to your target.Unload Magazine:Analogous to unloading a magazine into an M16A1. By removing the magazine, there won't be a round to chamber once you fire what is currently in the chamber. However, removing a magazine does not always mean "unchambering". As per standard gun safety, make sure the chamber is clear if you don't intend to continue using.Check Chamber and Bolt:This allows you to check what position the bolt is in, and whether a round is currently chambered.Open means that the bolt is locked back. This happens after completely firing through a magazine. When this happens, you need to unload the magazine, then load a new one, then either pull the charging handle or depress the bolt catch.Closed means that the bolt is currently closed and chances are that there's a round in the chamber. If you pull the charging handle here, it will eject the currently "chambered" word. Depressing the bolt catch does nothing.Check Selector Lever:This allows you to see what position the selector lever is currently in. Refer to the above description for the selector lever if you need to make changes.Check MagazineThis allows you to see if there is currently a "magazine" or text file loaded by the shortcut.Exit ShortcutExits shortcut.This is an example of how to use the shortcut. It will fire through two magazines (text files)1) Load Magazine2) Pull Charging Handle Back3) Move Selector Lever4) Pull Trigger5) Unload Magazine6) Load Magazine7) Depress Bolt Catch8) Pull Trigger9) Unload Magazine (optional)10) Check Chamber and Bolt (optional)11) Pull Charging Handle (optional)12) Move Selector Lever (optional)13) Exit ShortcutAnywhere in the shortcut, you could use the functions that start withCheck...in order to check the status of that part of the shortcut. For beginners who just want to get a hang of what function changes what, it is beneficial to check bolt and selector levers frequently.Enjoy?1.0 - May 26, 2022, 3:12 a.m.Initial ReleaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackVersion 2 MAJOR UPDATE THANKS TO Björn Hilbert who completely re wrote the shortcut adding a splash screen to add your API key and your name as well as he added contextual conversation. V1 gave miss ques, dropped prompts, now every chat seems smooth. A valid API key from openAI is needed. a single response use (not contextual) on average 200 tokens. 1000 tokens cost 2c This shortcut was originally adapted from @MateMarschalko shortcut for home automation. When I saw how it worked I knew it could re imagined into Siri~mate . I edited ,deleted and changed it's purpose from a home automation shortcut to a fun addition to siri. THIS DOES NOT REPLACE SIRI FOR ON DEVICE PROMPS AND REMINDERS. IT CANT OPEN APPS.
After downloading install your API key when prompted, as well as your username or how you want to be addressed by your personality aissistant.The text box that contains the instructions for chatgpt to who the personality is can be edited but be careful when editing one word, or the order will get notable changes in reply's. I found less is better. Each one took awhile testing personality directions and tweaking it to get a constant flow. Not to say you wont get gibberish, wrong answers, you will. it's not perfect. Check out all the personalities!It's really fun , the responses are not canned Asking general trivia questions or going into the detail of the personalities character chatGPT delivers the response in the style and cadence of the personality. ChatGPT is amazing!, this is what personal assistants should be. download them all, you’ll never be happier with multiple personalities. Easily pull up a new aissistant by just asking ! Please leave some feedback! or personalities you would like to see and we can see if it works. Not all ideas work, the personality has to be those larger than life animated personalities that have catch phrases or a way of speaking that is what defines them.2.0.2 - Jan. 29, 2023, 12:41 a.m.added natural reply question for personalityLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionThis is MLB Scoreboard!!!HighlightsNavigation ButtonsCustom SettingsLatest Release NotesFeedbackMLB Scoreboard is the best way to view scores and video highlights from MLB games in an order you choose.MLB Scoreboard lets you highlight your favorite teams, choose which order to display the scores and create a custom "hotbar" at the top of your list of scores which shows the scores from your favorite teams in the order of your choosing.This is what a typical MLB Scoreboard will look like once set up.You can tell which teams are the user’s favorite teams in a quick glance because their names appears in blue letters (both in the hotbar and in the general league scores below).Before a game starts, the teams' records are displayed along with the game start time. After the game starts, the display shows the score and game status (e.g. 🔺 4TH).If you click on the box containing the score from any game, MLB Scoreboard will open a new webpage in Safari with the game's highlights. You can scroll through the highlights to view them and press the back button at the bottom of the page to close it. If some of the videos don't initially load, press the reload button on your browser.There are five navigation buttons in the top right corner of your Scoreboard. Pressing the chevrons will show you the scores from the previous or next day. Pressing the reload button between the chevrons will update the scores in your MLB Scoreboard. Pressing the calendar button will let you chose a day to see scores from. And pressing the gear will open the settings menu. If you are viewing scores in the dropdown menu, you will see a pop up message asking you to confirm, that you want to leave shortcuts and open a link. The link reruns the MLB Scoreboard shortcut to open the highlights webpage - so press "open".The first time you use Scoreboard, you will be asked a few questions to setup the shortcut with your own custom settings. These include the teams you want to mark as your favorites, and the order to show them.Now that you know how MLB Scoreboard works, press the download button to begin experiencing your MLB Scoreboard.1.1 - Sept. 16, 2023, 10:07 p.m.Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackWarnings:DO NOT USE WITH SIRISAVE YOUR PROMPT BEFORE GENERATION———————————————————————Example of this shortcut’s work at the bottom.————————————————————————This is a backrooms level creator, a shortcut that allows you to easily create backrooms levels. Make sure you have a chatGPT account you can use.First, after the intro, it will ask you to provide the number of your level, this can be anything you want, just make sure that’s the number you want.Second, it will ask you for a name. You have 3 options, to generate a name, make your own name, or not to make one (Your level will just be called your number). If you choose to generate a name, it will be generated after level description is given.Thirdly, it will ask you for a detailed description of your level. It doesn’t have to be too detailed, but if you want to make your level exactly like you want, you would want to be detailed.Finally, it will say that it is generating the level, it will ask you if you want to start a new chat (New chat is definitely recommended), and what model you want to use. It will warn you that if you choose GPT-4, it may generate an image instead. Once the level is generated, you can review it, and then either speak it out loud, save it (as a note), or destroy it.That’s pretty much it! It only takes ~10 seconds to generate the level. This chatGPT has been trained on most of the backrooms wiki and multiple guides on how to create a good backrooms level. Make sure to save your prompt before generating just in case it isn’t how you want. I will be updating this a lot.———————————————————————————————Example (Warning: Long):———————————————————————————————Level 237 (Qwerty) is the 238th level of the Backrooms. It is classified as a Class 2 level, considered Unsafe and Unsecure. The Entity Count on this level varies, ranging from Low Entity Count to Moderate Entity Count, with occasional instances of High Entity Count due to provocation, and Entity Infestation if severe.Description of the Level:
Level 237 presents itself as an endlessly extending hallway with uniformly white-painted walls. The absence of a visible roof gives the impression of an infinite void overhead, although it is suspected that the upper space is obscured by a thick mist (though unconfirmed). Along both sides of this corridor are small offices, each equipped with standard computer setups featuring keyboards, mice, and chairs for users. These offices are arranged haphazardly and continue as far as the eye can see.Within these offices, facelings may be encountered, but it's crucial not to provoke them by interfering with the computers. These entities remain docile until the computers are turned off, at which point they may become hostile. A notable hazard on this level is the dense mist that envelops the entire area. Prolonged inhalation of this mist can prove toxic, although wearing medical face coverings can provide adequate protection.Bases, Outposts, and Communities:
Survivors on Level 237 have established makeshift outposts within some of the offices, using the computers for communication and data gathering. These outposts serve as bases of operation, enabling limited survival in this challenging environment. The mist's toxicity has prompted the creation of specialized face masks to ensure the safety of those residing in these outposts.Entrances and Exits:
Access to Level 237 is primarily gained through random entry points within the Backrooms. Exiting the level can be just as unpredictable, as wanderers may find themselves transported to other areas without warning. Communication and information transmission about this level have been sporadic due to its inherent dangers, making it challenging to disseminate knowledge to others.Please note that the exact nature of Level 237 remains under investigation, and the mist's origins are yet to be confirmed. Wanderers are advised to exercise caution and avoid provoking facelings if they wish to navigate this level safely.2.00 - Nov. 23, 2023, 11:59 p.m.Added multiple variations to the prompts for generating levels, allowing you to choose.Changed the wording of some of the speakingAllowed you to view the format the level will be in.Allowed you to copy it to clipboard.Made main prompt much, MUCH, better.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

For example, let's say the current number is 9 and you add 1 it'll be 10, that means it'll be 10 for everyone publicly until someone else adds another 1 and it'll be 11. So it'll just keep adding to the number publicly and on Jan 1, 2024 at 12 am the counter number will be reset to 0.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackPortfolioGithubv0.1This shortcut requires2other shortcut to function:ObsidianTarot(PullCard)ObsidianTarot(GPTHelper)When you first install this shortcut, it should ask you where you would like to store your readings within your Obsidian Vault.I had set it up where the readings within the same day will be appended within the same note with a timestamp. (if it is the 1st reading of the day, it will create the note with the date as the title).TitleFormat =Reading M-dd-yyTitle =Reading 4-20-23Occasionally, it will wiki link the cardName in the reading itself. It is pretty harmless imo, but let me know.If you keep experiencing a cut off response, you can edit themax_tokenvalue in the shortcut.Three Card pull sometimes get duplicate card / 3 of the same suiteThe following are sample responses:==12:10 PM==IV OF CUPS Upright can represent a new perspective, or a sense of awareness of emotionally charged feelings. On this particular day, it is important to pay attention to how your emotions can influence your decisions and take into account the consequences of your actions. Take a few moments to pause and reflect before making a move that could potentially disrupt your emotional balance.==11:32 PM==Should I get cheese balls?Yes. The III of Wands signifies that this is a good time to take action and make decisions with confidence. This card often suggests a sense of ambition and optimism - so in this case, it is a positive indicator that you should go ahead and get the cheese balls!==10:27 AM==Will I hear back from that recruiter from yesterday?[[VI OF WANDS]] Inverted: You may be disappointed as the answer will likely not be the one you were hoping for. Be patient and keep pursuing other opportunities. [[III OF WANDS]] Upright: You may hear something back soon, as preparations are being made for your next step. Be proactive and think of creative ways to stand out. [[II OF SWORDS]] Inverted: The situation may be clouded by emotions and confusion, causing delays to your response. Hold a positive attitude and let go of any expectations you may have.v0.1 - April 27, 2023, 1:47 a.m.init.Saves markdown of reading onto a daily note, if note already exists for the day, append it.Cards are chosen from PullCard helper, then fed into GPT helper to retrieve a reading.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

V1 gave miss ques, dropped prompts, now every chat seems smooth. A valid API key from openAI is needed. a single response use (not contextual) on average 200 tokens. 1000 tokens cost 2c This shortcut was originally adapted from @MateMarschalko shortcut for home automation. When I saw how it worked I knew it could re imagined into Siri~mate . I edited ,deleted and changed it's purpose from a home automation shortcut to a fun addition to siri. THIS DOES NOT REPLACE SIRI FOR ON DEVICE PROMPS AND REMINDERS. IT CANT OPEN APPS. After downloading install your API key when prompted, as well as your username or how you want to be addressed by your personality aissistant.The text box that contains the instructions for chatgpt to who the personality is can be edited but be careful when editing one word, or the order will get notable changes in reply's. I found less is better. Each one took awhile testing personality directions and tweaking it to get a constant flow. Not to say you wont get gibberish, wrong answers, you will. it's not perfect. Check out all the personalities!It's really fun , the responses are not canned Asking general trivia questions or going into the detail of the personalities character chatGPT delivers the response in the style and cadence of the personality. ChatGPT is amazing!, this is what personal assistants should be. download them all, you’ll never be happier with multiple personalities. Easily pull up a new aissistant by just asking ! Please leave some feedback! or personalities you would like to see and we can see if it works. Not all ideas work, the personality has to be those larger than life animated personalities that have catch phrases or a way of speaking that is what defines them.1.0 - Feb. 2, 2023, 8:54 p.m.firstarino versionLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackChandrayaan-3 (transl. Moon-craft, pronunciation (help·info))[7] is the third Indian lunar exploration mission under the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Chandrayaan programme.[7] It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The propulsion module carried the lander and rover configuration to lunar orbit in preparation for a powered descent by the lander.[8][9]Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023.[10] The lander and rover landed at the lunar south pole region[11] on 23 August 2023 at 18:02 IST, making India the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole[12] and the fourth country to soft-land on the Moon.[4][13][14][15][16]Background
Further information: Chandrayaan programme
On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) launch vehicle consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover.[17] The lander was scheduled to touch down on the lunar surface in September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover. The lander ultimately crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land.[18][19]Following Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and further lunar missions were proposed.[20]The European Space Tracking network (ESTRACK), operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), is supporting the mission. Under a new cross-support arrangement, ESA tracking support could be provided for upcoming ISRO missions such as those of India's first human spaceflight programme, Gaganyaan, and the Aditya-L1 solar research mission. In return, future ESA missions will receive similar support from ISRO's own tracking stations.[21]Objectives
ISRO's mission objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission were:Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.
Observing and demonstrating the rover's driving capabilities on the Moon.
Conducting and observing experiments on the materials available on the lunar surface to better understand the composition of the Moon.[22]
Spacecraft
Design
Chandrayaan-3 comprised three main components:Propulsion module
The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration to a 100 kilometres (62 mi) lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with a large solar panel mounted on one side and a cylindrical mounting structure for the lander (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) on top.[9][8]
Lander
The Vikram lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters capable of producing 800 newtons of thrust each. It carries the rover and various scientific instruments to perform on-site analysis.[23][24]
The lander for Chandrayaan-3 has four variable-thrust engines with slew rate changing capabilities, unlike Chandrayaan-2's lander, which had five, with the fifth one being centrally mounted and capable only of fixed thrust. One of the main reasons for Chandrayaan-2 landing failure, attitude increase during the camera coasting phase, was removed by allowing the lander to control attitude and thrust during all phases of descent. Attitude correction rate is increased from Chandrayaan-2's 10°/s to 25°/s with Chandrayaan-3. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander will be equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to allow measuring attitude in 3 directions.[25][26] The impact legs have been made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and instrumentation redundancy has been improved. It will target a more precise 4 km (2.5 mi) by 4 km (2.5 mi) landing region based on images previously provided by the Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC) onboard Chandrayaan-2's orbiter. ISRO improved the structural rigidity, increased polling in instruments, increased data frequency and transmission, and added additional multiple contingency systems to improve lander survivability in the event of failures during descent and landing.[27][26]
Rover
The Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle with a mass of 26 kilograms (57 pounds). It is 917 millimetres (3.009 ft) x 750 millimetres (2.46 ft) x 397 millimetres (1.302 ft) in size.[28]
The rover is expected to take multiple measurements to support research into the composition of the lunar surface, the presence of water ice in the lunar soil, the history of lunar impacts, and the evolution of the Moon's atmosphere.[29][11]

LaunchLVM3 M4, Chandrayaan-3 – Launch vehicle lifting off from the second launch pad of SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota
Chandrayaan-3 was launched aboard an LVM3-M4 rocket on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, entering an Earth parking orbit with a perigee of 170 km (106 mi) and an apogee of 36,500 km (22,680 mi).Orbit
After a series of manoeuvres that placed Chandrayaan-3 in a trans-lunar injection orbit,[31][32][33] ISRO performed a lunar-orbit insertion (LOI) on 5 August, successfully placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into orbit around the Moon. The LOI operation was carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC) located in Bengaluru.[34][35]On 17 August, the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module to begin the last phase of the mission.[36]Descent
On 23 August 2023, as the lander approached the low point of its orbit, its four engines fired as a braking manoeuvre at 30 kilometres (19 mi) above the Moon's surface. After 11.5 minutes, the lander was 7.2 km (4.5 miles) above the surface; it maintained its altitude for about 10 seconds, then stabilized itself using eight smaller thrusters and rotated from a horizontal to a vertical position while continuing its descent.It then used two of its four engines to slow its descent to roughly 150 metres (490 ft); it hovered there for about 30 seconds before continuing downward and touching down at 12:32 UTC.[37][38]Stages of Chandrayaan-3 deployment and flight

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackFor this you will need an OpenAi account API key. This shortcut connects to ChatGPT. Run the shortcut manually the first couple times just by tapping on it and following the prompts accordingly. Then run it with your voice a couple times by saying hey Siri speak with data or whatever you chose as its name. this will initiate the shortcut.I brought Lieutenant Commander Data to life, and subsequently the whole of Star Trek. He thinks he’s on the Enterprise with full access to the ship’s systems, including the holodeck. You can ask him to perform any duties he would normally on the Enterprise including scans, checking for messages from starfleet for potential missions to run, doing repairs, using the tricorder, etc. To perform an action such as tapping your comm badge, just preface it with the word ‘Action’ - I.e., “Action taps communicator”. Use your imagination as a Trekkie on that. My favorite part: you can tell him to design and run a complete Holosuite program, including one based on the famed Sherlock Holmes episode, or a combat mission, a science and discovery mission, a trip to Riza…it’s truly remarkable. As a Trekkie myself, it feels like playing an extremely detailed, text-based Star Trek simulation.1 - April 5, 2023, 7:55 a.m.Full context support so Data remembers the conversation while it’s active, with the option of deleting the conversation afterwards or if it gets too large. (If the shortcut stops working suddenly, a too large conversation file is likely the reason.)Log inorsign upto leave feedback.
