It is similar to San Francisco Compact Rounded, but especially the lowercase o is very different from the font used. Therefore it is unfortunately not possible that the name appears in the correct font face. Instead it appears in the regular San Francisco font face.Apple and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.‌Cardhas an integrated update mechanism calledEmbed-a-Update. Thanks to the embedded updater,Carddoes not require any external updater shortcut.

As a result, I was forced to find a new API to build this shortcut around. After much digging and research, it seems the best option is Avalara’s AvaTax API. This new version is built entirely around this new platform, and as such will require you to set up a new account.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

Little did I know that months later I'd still be hard at work on it, adding features, solving problems and creating something much more ambitious than the simple "Get Calendar Events" list my shortcut originally comprised of.Youtube LinkIf you’d like, create a new Bills calendar to house your bills separately from your personal/work events, however this isn’t a necessity.The date that each bill event is scheduled for is interpreted as the Due Date for that bill. You can set your bill events as All Day
events for improved organization and legibility.There are three parts to a calendar event that must be formatted correctly to be recognized by ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 :Title₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 distinguishes between bills and regular calendar entries by only looking for events withTitlesthat start with the wordBill:If you want toexcludea bill from being found by ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 by default - for example if the bill is automatically paid each month without action on your part - include the word (AutoPay) within parenthesis at theendof theTitle.At the top of the shortcut's Edit view, there is a toggle to show/hide these AutoPay bills within ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪. When shown, an AutoPay bill can be distinguished from other bills by a small spinning gear in the bottom middle of its icon.Notes₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 will parse the event’sNotesand extract any currency ($230 , $12.34 , $1056.90) which is used to determine the amount due for each bill.Additionally, for Person-to-Person (P2P) payments through Pay, Square Cash or Venmo, ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 searchesNotesfor the name of a contact to send the payment to.Names will not be recognized unless they’re in your address book, and are Properly Capitalized.E.g. “$50 Sandra” or “John Appleseed $2.50”Note that at this time, only currency amounts beginning with US Dollar signs are recognized.URLThe text entered into a bill event’sURLfield tells ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 what action to take when a bill is selected for payment.If a bill is paid in Safari, theURLfield is where the appropriate website address beginning with http:// or https:// is entered.If a bill is instead paid through a specific App, enter that app’s name in theURLfield. Within the Customize Shortcut setup wizard, you'll have the opportunity to configure what App names correspond to the actual "Open App" actionsFor P2P payments, simply set theURLto the wordP2P(and remember to write the name of the payment recipient intoNotes).Extra SettingsAt the top of the Shortcut's Edit View, there are a few extra quick settings toggles to enable extra features.I highly recommend leaving the CreateExamples toggle set to True the first time you run ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪, which will generate four Example bills in your Calendar and allow you to see how ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 performs.In addition to the toggle to enable/disable visibility of AutoPay bills, there's also an option to disable the rich auto-generated icons, which will let ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 to launch faster, as well as allow most of the Shortcut's workflow to be performed within the Widget view.Additionally, there's an option to have ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 text your bank's mobile-banking number to retrieve your account balance when run if you so choose, and you'll also find a place to adjust the search timeframes that ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪 looks for bills (past and future).Regarding the icons that get auto-generated within ₿𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕪's bill selector list, I've released a shortcutherethat allows you to create similar lists within your own shortcuts.That's it!

You can add a gift card with the first option, and it lets you know that there are no gift cards to check, or spend on. Tapping onAdd Gift Cardwill prompt you to enter a name and then an amount, then display a menu that congratulates you on the gift card and shows you the information that you just entered.Spending on a gift card is easy, just tap onSpend On Your Cardand it will prompt you to select your card and then enter the amount spent. After that it will display a message that shows you how much you spent and how much is left on the card, then present a menu populated with the same information just as a reminder.If you are lucky enough to have multiple gift cards, ShortCards makes it easy to track more than one as well! Every time you add a new card, it will dynamically add a new menu item to both theCheck BalanceandSpend on Cardmenu options. When spending you'll need to tap on the card you want to spend on.ShortCards uses Data Jar to store data since it makes it so much easier. There are some loose plans to use iCloud, but it's a lot messier and more difficult to manage.0.8 - Feb. 21, 2024, 6:49 p.m.Initial UploadLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackIn einer Welt, in der digitale Zahlungen immer präsenter werden, stoßen Händler und Verbraucher oft auf Schwierigkeiten im Umgang mit etablierten Zahlungsmethoden. Die Notwendigkeit, teure Kartenterminals anzuschaffen und komplexe Verträge abzuschließen, stellt eine Barriere für viele Kleinunternehmen dar. Zudem können Zahlungen über Plattformen wie GiroPay zu unnötigen Datenschutzproblemen führen, da persönliche Kontaktdaten preisgegeben werden müssen. Auch die Möglichkeit unbefugter Abbuchungen nach Kartenzahlungen sorgt für Unsicherheit.Vor diesem Hintergrund entstand die Vision von SimplePay: eine innovative Plattform, die es Händlern ermöglicht, Kartenzahlungen mithilfe von QR-Codes über GiroPay bequem und sicher zu akzeptieren, während die Anonymität der Transaktionspartner gewahrt bleibt. Die Motivation hinter der Gründung von SimplePay entspringt der Faszination für moderne Zahlungsmethoden und der Begeisterung, ein nahtloses und sicheres Zahlungserlebnis zu schaffen.SimplePay setzt auf bewährte Technologien, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Plattform nutzt iPhones, um QR-Codes zu generieren und zu scannen. Die GiroPay-Integration erlaubt schnelle und sichere Überweisungen, während die Banken die Sicherheit und Integrität der Transaktionen gewährleisten.Ein herausragendes Merkmal von SimplePay ist die Anonymität der Transaktionspartner. Durch das Generieren von temporären Kontakten in der Sparkassen App können Käufer und Verkäufer Transaktionen initiieren, ohne ihre persönlichen Kontaktdaten preiszugeben. Dieser Prozess ermöglicht eine einzigartige Mischung aus Datenschutz und Komfort. Zusätzlich bietet SimplePay eine Absicherung gegen unerwünschte Abbuchungen, indem Käufer jede Transaktion in der App bestätigen müssen.Die Benutzererfahrung steht im Mittelpunkt von SimplePay. Das Generieren von QR-Codes und die Durchführung von Zahlungen sind mühelos und intuitiv gestaltet. Dank der Unterstützung von Kurzbefehlen auf iPhones können Nutzer schnell auf die Funktionen zugreifen.SimplePay ist momentan exklusiv für Nutzer der Sparkasse und auf iPhones verfügbar. Zukünftige Entwicklungspläne umfassen die Veröffentlichung einer eigenständigen App und die Prüfung der Erweiterung der Kompatibilität auf weitere Banken.SimplePay verfolgt ein transparentes Geschäftsmodell, das für Nutzer keine Gebühren vorsieht. Der Fokus liegt auf der Verbreitung der Plattform unter Verkäufern und Käufern.SimplePay verändert die Art und Weise, wie Menschen Zahlungen tätigen. Mit einer klaren Vision, innovativer Technologie und dem Engagement für Datenschutz und Nutzerfreundlichkeit bringt SimplePay eine neue Ära der Kartenzahlungen.

It calculates the total value of each of my shares in the whole portfolio, then adds those values together at the end so I can see total value.This shortcut is fetching stocks and shares data from Yahoo Finance, and also has access to Wise's Currency Converter.Just want to note, I have zero investments in any of these stocks in the sample data of this shortcut.I was mostly looking at UK stocks and shares when building this shortcut up. I later thought to add the necessary parts that would at least enable me to convert costs from EUR or USD to GBP.Feel free to adapt to your needs.
