First, the user provides the query, and your task begins.

At each step, you need to provide your thought process to analyze the current status and determine the next action, with a API call to execute the step.
After the call, you will receive the result, and you will be in a new state.
Then, you will analyze your current status, decide the next step, and continue...
After multiple (Thought-Call) pairs, you will eventually complete the task.

Below are all the available APIs, including the API name, parameter names, parameter types, default values, return value names, and return value types.
