- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackAs a medical student preparing for board exams, practice questions are essential to building stamina and familiarizing oneself to the testing environment before the big day.

Originally made to prepare for my COMLEX exam, this shortcut can be used for any test preparation and gives you a 1-tap access to your running tally, tells you how many questions you have left before you reach your goal, gives you your daily total, and intelligently calculates the daily average needed to reach your goal by a certain date. Updating info is easy, and convenient menu options allow for error corrections in case you type in a wrong number by mistake.With one tap, you can see your daily summary, a breakdown of your overall progress, and precisely enter in your progress for the day in the qbank of your choice.It also works with widgets on iOS. Now you can record your questions from anywhere!To turn on the widget, go to the left of the home screen, scroll all the way down, tap “edit”, then tap the green “+” button next to “shortcuts.”The new “Question Log” feature allows you to record how many questions you did on a certain day, from which QBank you did them, and how well you did.Numbers are for demo purposes, and are not my actual statsRequires “UI Library” by @entee.Now you can choose up to 4 question banks that you wish to record your counts for, making this tool accessible even for students preparing for other exams!

Simply set your preferences, and you’ll be good to go. It turns on do not disturb, sets your timer, your preferred volume of music, and gets your favorite focus music/noises going from a pre-selected playlist. It also includes notifications to keep track of what round you’re on.Note: I use it from my phone while I study on my iPad because it requires the app to be open constantly, due to the need of the “wait” action. That’s why the brightness is dimmed: so the iPhone uses as little energy as possible. If you want to use it on the device you study with, just get rid of the “set brightness” action.
This was made before the addition of the “timer” functionality, so it’s a little messy. I may make updates to the mechanism in the future, but we’ll have to see.1.2 - Nov. 26, 2018, 4:30 p.m.Got rid of UpdateKit for the sake of speed.Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

This shortcut sends bash scripts to a target device through SSH that can cause system hangs or crashes.You can send a bomb that detonates instantly, or a time bomb that will wait for a set amount of seconds and then activates.Note that whatever you SSH into can figure out your IP address, so don't go bombing random servers.This shortcut is meant to be a practical joke to play on yourself or close friends.As with any SSH, you will need to know the IP address, host name, password, and port of your target device.A fork bomb, if you don't know, is a process that duplicates itself and wastes memory, causing the system to crash. The bomb used here is the classic bash fork bomb: :(){ :|:& };: This is used to crash iOS devices, but should work on linux too.The bomb used to freeze macOS is a for loop that spams the unix 'yes' function, which uses up CPU pretty quick. The crash bomb uses sudo halt to shut down the device.0.5 - Nov. 18, 2020, 4:09 a.m.-fix sudo on macOSLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackRecursion is a powerful tool in programming. It's the idea that an algorithm can call itself. Factorial is a great example of this:4! = 4 * 3!3! = 3 * 2!2! = 2 * 1!1! = 1iOS Shortcuts also support recursion, in other words, a Shortcut call call itself. This has a variety of applications.The dangerous thing is that if a Shortcut supports UpdateKit, it might try to run UpdateKit each time it calls itself. UpdateKit takes a few seconds to run, so this process could take a long time.This Shortcut is an example of how to handle recursion well with UpdateKit.It works like this. All recursive algorithms have what’s known as an exit condition. It’s basically an if-statement that checks whether or not to recurse again. Recursive Shortcuts don’t have to have an exit condition, but they should. You should put all your UpdateKit actions in the branch of the exit condition that’s called when it’s not about to recurse.Download the Shortcut, play around with it, see how it works, maybe even tweak it a little bit, then integrate the ideas into your own Shortcut.

However, some systems or emails may have requirements regarding the size of uploaded files. For example, I can think of government agencies that can only receive attachments around 2 megabytes in size. As a result, many users want to reduce the size of the PDF. This not only reduces the file but also frees up memory.Instruction:1.) Select one of three quality levels. My tip: Medium quality!2.) Please choose a file from your iCloud Drive to create a reduced PDF! (This is done by image reduction)3.) Info: This process may take some time depending on the size of the source file!4.)

- Description: DescriptionSample menu with update availableSample menu with no update availableLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut provides a tutorial on how to create your own unobtrusive shortcut updater. The shortcut will silently check for updates. If one is available it will automatically add the update option to a list menu of your choice with a non-obtrusive option to update to the newest version of the shortcut.This tutorial will give you a step-by-step guide of how to create a basic Routine Hub updater.First we will need a dictionary like this one:This dictionary gives information about the shortcut you are using.
- Name is the name of the shortcut
- Author is your name
- Version is the shortcut version
- RHID is the shortcut’s ID on RoutineHub. The RHID can be found in the shortcut’s url. For example, the Silent Updater Tutorial url is https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7542/. So it’s RHID is 7542.RoutineHub has an API to get information about the latest version of a shortcut. The address is in the form:https://routinehub.co/api/v1/shortcuts/[RHID]/versions/latest. The [RHID] value in the API would be the actual RoutineHub ID. However, in our shortcut, we will pull that value from the dictionary above. You could also replace it with the actual number.The action above went online to get the API information from RoutineHub. The information is saved as a json dictionary in the format:The next action saves that information as a variable called update details.Then we add a number action which retrieves the Update Details action as a dictionary and uses the value of the Version key. In order to add this action yourself, add Update Details as the number value, click on the name to bring up the action’s information, click where it says “as file” and change the type to “Dictionary”. In the “Get Value For Key” area, set the value for Key to “Version” (case sensitive).The next step is to add an if action which will compare the version number from above with the current version number from the initial dictionary. If the online version number is larger than the current shortcut’s version number, it triggers the if action’s option, otherwise it skips it.If the if action is triggered, it creates a variable with the value “Update [shortcut name] to Version [current online version number]”. Then, the value is saved as a variable called update.Next we get to our list where the update appears (shown in action at the top of this description).The list below has 4 options. The first one is the update variable created in the if action above. If the variable has no value (because there is no update available), it will not appear in the choose from list action and there will only be three choices.The list is followed by a choose from list action which is used to choose from the above list.Next we use an if action to see if an update is available and the user selected the update option from the list above.If the update routine is triggered, we add actions to do four steps:You then end the if action and have completed embedding a silent Updater.Now you can continue with the rest of your shortcut.0.4 - Dec. 27, 2020, 7:58 a.m.Bug fixLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

That version can run on anything with support for python3.Download the shortcut. Follow the prompts given. If you want to pass in a text file to encrypt, activate Crypt from the file's share sheet.This shortcut is meant to provide a sort of encryption for simple messages. Say you want to send someone a text message without someone else being able to read it. You can use this shortcut to send a string of numbers containing the message.This shortcut was based off of the concept of OTP (One Time Pad), so each letter of message is randomly altered; this shortcut uses simple math. As I have not extensively studied encryption methods, I could be completely wrong about OTP. The shortcut seems to work anyway.The TLDR of the mechanism:Split message into letters, spaces, basic punctuationAssign numeric value to each split item (ASCII)Randomly generate number as keyAdd said random key to aforementioned numberFor example, let's encrypt the string "hello". The shortcut will split each letter apart, creating a list ofEach character is then converted to ASCII, which becomesFor each number, a random "key" is generated, which is a random integer from 2 to 750, wihch is then added to the number in the ASCII list. If for example our keys were generated asthen our final encrypted message is:Then the encrypted message and the key are combined with colons and exported.To decrypt, run the process in reverse.3.0 - March 6, 2022, 9:29 a.m.- removed shared key because it was pointless- reworked manipulation to use addition instead of multiplication, as encrypted strings were very longLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

Some of the creators in the community like me amongst many others are looking into making their shortcuts more fluent and cleaner.Charles Reed sparked the idea of making the VCF menu’s in a shortcut Dictionary based.
So basically what happens in this shortcut is that the dictionary is populated with the needed data.When the shortcut is ran every VCF menu needed is pre generated and can be pulled at any moment by inserting two actions.So in the end this makes the menu’s needed way cleaner. No longer large blocks of text in the editor.

PDF files are considered to be the most commonly used format for sending documents. However, some systems or emails may have requirements regarding the size of uploaded files. For example, I can think of government agencies that can only receive attachments around 2 megabytes in size. As a result, many users want to reduce the size of the PDF. This not only reduces the file but also frees up memory.Instruction:1.) Select one of three quality levels. My tip: Medium quality!2.) Please choose one or more image file(s) from your Photo Library to create a reduced PDF! (This is done by image reduction)3.) Info: This process may take some time depending on the size of the source file!4.) Your PDF file in low quality is now created!5.)

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackDownload the shortcut. Make sure it is attached to the share sheet. Make sure you have iCloud Drive enabled.This is an iMessage-only implementation of my other shortcut, Crypt. Crypt is meant to provide a sort of encryption for simple messages. Say you want to send someone a text message without someone else being able to read it. You can use this shortcut to send a string of numbers containing the message.To encrypt a message with iMessage-Crypt, either activate the shortcut without input from the share sheet, or just run the shortcut through Shortcuts.app. You will be asked to provide a string message. Once it is encrypted, the shortcut will create a zip file and save it to /Shortcuts/iMessage-Crypt/ in iCloud Drive with the following contents:txt.txt (contains encoded message string, encoded again with base64)m4a.m4a (an audio file of Apple's notification ding. It's metadata contains the key encoded with base64 in the Artist field. The rest of the fields are filled with a random base64 encode)This zip is then sent through iMessage, but you'll need to specify who to send it to. All files related to the zip are deleted after the iMessage is successfully sent.--To decrypt, select the zip file sent to you in iMessage and open the share sheet. Activate iMessage-Crypt from there.Decryption is done in reverse, with the shortcut extracting the archive and reading the content of both extracted files. The text and artist metadata are both base64 decoded, and used to recreate the unencrypted message.This shortcut was based off of the concept of OTP (One Time Pad), so each letter of message is randomly altered; this shortcut uses simple math. As I have not extensively studied encryption methods, I could be completely wrong about OTP. The shortcut seems to work anyway.The TLDR of the mechanism:Split message into letters, spaces, basic punctuationAssign numeric value to each split item (ASCII)Randomly generate number as keyAdd said random key to aforementioned numberEncode key and final encoded message with base64Save encoded key to txt.txtCreate an audio file with the encoded message as metadataZip both files into an archiveFor example, let's encrypt the string "hello". The shortcut will split each letter apart, creating a list ofEach character is then converted to ASCII, which becomesFor each number, a random "key" is generated, which is a random integer from 2 to 750, wihch is then added to the number in the ASCII list. If for example our keys were generated asthen our final encrypted message is:Then the encrypted message and the key are combined with colons and exported.To decrypt, run the process in reverse.0.2 - April 14, 2022, 3:18 p.m.Finished encoding for metadata of the audio fileLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis is a GUI for arp spoofing, inspired by netkillUI from Teggers. It requires jailbreak and the installation of various packages listed below. Keep in mind that if you use this on a network you do not own or have permission to break, it is probablyILLEGAL, and you areNOT ANONYMOUS.You will need to be jailbroken and have SSH configured to listen on some port. This can be set using [OpenSSH Settings], found on default repos. Please read the description below before using the shortcut.Masquerade is a 'GUI' for ARP spoofing. It automates the use of the arpspoof command. This shortcut uses the arpspoof project found here: (https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/arpspoof). As a result, it needs Python3 and pip to install."In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead." - WikipediaThe device that you target, or kill, will likely have their network connection seemingly turned off, but it is just redirecting to your device.Upon installing the shortcut, you will be asked to provide your device's root password and SSH port. This is used to log in as root to use the arpspoof command. It does not send anything back to me, and the only internet connection required is only used for installing and actually running arpspoof.Probably the choice you were looking for. This function leads to the actual arpspoof command. Use it to select a device to kill. You are then given the following options:This runs the command arp -a, which lists all IP addresses of devices connected to the network. You can then select a specific IP to kill. If there are many devices on your network, scanning will take a long time to complete.Sometimes there may be way too many IP addresses to comb through. If you know your target IP address, you can enter it here.This option kills all devices detected through arp -a. If it looks like the shortcut is hanging, that is probably normal and depends on how many devices are connected to the network. Use this with caution.In all cases, a confirmation notification will be shown once the arpspoof command has been run. The specific command for all above options is: "arpspoof -i en0 -t <target IP> -r <your IP> &>/dev/null &". This puts arpspoof in background, and allows you to run multiple attacks at once.Runs "killall python3". As arpspoof runs as a python process, this will kill any arpspoof process currently running.This installs arpspoof from GitHub. There is a subsection that allows you to install pip as well, if it is not already installed. More information about installation is below.It is recommended to install pip and arpspoof yourself in order to see what errors may occur, but the shortcut has a script to install both packages automatically. The shortcut executes the commands listed below AS ROOT USER. These are the same steps as with installing manually through a terminal or SSH.To install pip:To install arpspoof from Github [pip must be installed first]:Masquerade automates the process using shortcuts, but this means you cannot debug or see where errors occur in the spoofing process. If you wish to manually use arpspoof, you can follow the steps below in a terminal like NewTerm, or through SSH.Before anything, you should find your own ip address. This can be found in Settings.app, or using commands like ifconfig if installed. Then, in the first step, we will invoke the root user, as arpspoof needs root privilege to run. The next step scans for IP addresses connected to the network. Here, you can find yourtargetIP address. For the next command, put yourtarget IP addressin the place of XXX.XXX.XXX, andyour IP addressin the place of YYY.YYY.YYY. The terminal should then show you the output of the command.Again, please be very careful when using this shortcut. Firstly if you do this on a network you do not own or have permission to break, it is probably ILLEGAL, and you are NOT ANONYMOUS. Secondly, it will probably ruin your battery life to leave this running. Be sure you know what you are doing.Thanks to byt3bl33d3r and TeggersThank you for using Masquerade!1.0 - Nov. 17, 2021, 2:08 a.m.Initial releaseLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

Once configured you can use it to quickly translate Chinese text.By default It doesn't use Google lens translate unless you activate it in the shortcut's dictionary of options. If you choose to enable Google lens translation the shortcut will take a screenshot which can then be selected in the album view of lens before the delete prompt shows up.Remarks:
I have this shortcut configured to use the triple back tap. For the double back tap I created another shortcut called Clipboard Translate Chinese. Together these two shortcuts have helped me fill the gap left by more advanced tools I had originally created for my Android phone.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackPodcast Pauses allows language learners to listen to podcasts with pauses every few seconds. I have found that these breaks help me to concentrate, to process the language and be aware of new phrases.In order to listen with AirPods while walking or running the shortcut repeatedly plays a silent sound file to keep it running with the phone/screen turned off. This works fairly well most of the time!Because the pauses occur at a fixed interval rather than respecting natural breaks after words and sentences a short “rewind” occurs to cover cut-off speech. This isn’t ideal but works well enough.If you want to try different timings make sure you duplicate the shortcut first.

We are sad to announce that this means we will no longer be using our API in the shortcut, however it is still available for use. To ensure you can continue to use this shortcut, we have added some instructions on how to use your own API instead.We'd like to thank you all for understanding and we look forward to working with you all again on more projects in the future.

Then the AI will turn it into notes. There’s also a summarizer that will summarize any text source that you paste. There’s even a tool that will make your sentences and phrases, unless redundant! Just put in a phrase from your essay that you wanna repeat, and it will show you how to refreeze it.1.0 - Aug. 12, 2023, 9:51 a.m.First version!

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis example shortcut is for people who already have a basic familiarity with Siri Shortcuts. It’s also assumed that you know how to name and read names of action blocks so that you can know which action references which other action block. This is not a lesson in basic shortcut creation. If this entire example confuses you, please seek out tutorials on the basics of shortcuts.Many people want to be able to set and retrieve data using shortcuts and have that data be consistently retrievable. The best way to set usable data is with dictionaries. An app that lets you easily view and modify saved dictionaries is called “Jayson”. It’s not a required app for this shortcut but look for it in the app store, download it, and set it up anyway. You’ll be glad you did.The smartest save format for shortcut dictionaries is “.json”. Assuming you have never used that format, it doesn’t matter where/how else it can be used. We’re only discussing Siri Shortcuts here. This also isn’t the place to discuss the Why’s of the .json format. We’re here for the How’s.The Jayson app works best with .json files, hence its name.Many people have discussed nested dictionaries and it’s easy to know how to get data from them but nobody ever provided an easy-to-read working example of how to set them, so that’s why I created this. It can’t be used by other shortcuts to set anything but it’s here for you to test and learn from it.When you first run this shortcut, it won’t already have a file saved that it can use. When you run it again, it will. If there’s not already a “Test Nest Dict” subfolder in the iCloud ”Shortcuts” folder with “Test.json” inside, it will create it and continue. If there already are both, it will just continue.Each time you run this shortcut, the previous dictionary data you generated and saved is wiped. The purpose is so you can examine only the results of the dictionary code you’re testing and not get lost or confused. Look for my companion shortcut that shows you how to save every change or addition you make to a .json file.To make it easier for you, I’ve created a Choose From Menu. You choose which dictionary you wish to test and it will be used.Examine the shortcut code carefully, read my included comments, run the shortcut, choose from the menu which dictionary saving method you want to test and learn, then examine the resultant .json file to see how it worked and what it saved.V1 - Nov. 28, 2022, 9:41 a.m.-Log inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

You could even automatically leave your meeting on macOS after a certain amount of minutes from entering. Regardless, you could automate this shortcut to join your meetings for you automatically.You can use only one VacZoom shortcut per meeting schedule because VacZoom will store only enough information to join one meeting. As a result, I recommend renaming it per class or schedule and creating copies for each.Once you open the shortcut, commented directions will be present at the top.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackThis shortcut has a single, limited purpose: to compare two sets of Chinese characters, and if any match, to show the matching characters in the Pleco app.The intention of this is to compare lists of newly addedOutlier Dictionarycharacters to yourSkritterWords list to see if there are any new entries or expert entries for characters you have already learned, so you can see those characters in the Outlier Dictionary, but it will work with any two sets of Chinese characters.Tap the “Get Shortcut” button to the left. The Shortcuts app will open and offer to import the shortcut (if nothing happens after Shortcuts opens, come back and tap “Get Shortcut” again).Go tohttps://skritter.com/words, select “Export,” and export your learned words (see Note below).Run the shortcut, and choose whether to compare the file to all new Outlier entries, all entries with new Expert info, or the clipboard contents.When prompted, select the file from Step 1.The shortcut will compare the two lists, find any matches, and open Pleco with a list of the results so you can view the new Outlier entries or Outlier Expert entries (you must purchase the Outlier dictionary within Pleco to view the Outlier entries).Note:You can use any text file containing Chinese characters in Steps 1 and 3, but it may take a long time to process if there are a lot of non-Chinese characters in the file, or simply a lot of characters, period.

Like the Notion Web Clipper extension on Chrome and Firefox, if you share a YouTube link to the shortcut, it will add a YouTube video block to the page.This shortcut is based onNotion Note v2.

To give it access to a database:You can now access this database via the Notion API.To edit the database though, you need the database's ID. You can find this in the URL to your database.

There were a couple of features I always wished for:So, I've created an iOS Shortcut companion to expand DuoLingo's functionality!During your Spanish class, you simply need to activate the shortcut (there are two different ways to do it) and select the language in which you'd like the sentence to be pronounced.1) Go to: Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices2) Download voices you want to use3) Download "Duolingo en-es" shortcut and proceed setup steps4) Setup the way you want to run this shortcut - Assistive Touch or Back Tap5) Start DuoLingo class and enjoy!Personally, I prefer Assistive Touch, as Back Tap may occasionally trigger the shortcut when it's not needed at all.Occasionally, the iOS recognition system may make errors and miss some letters. In such cases, you can try running the shortcut once or twice more, or simply move on.Certain exercises may contain more than one sentence. In such instances, you'll be prompted to choose the correct number of sentences.If you activate the shortcut after you've answered and pressed "CHECK," the script will take the answer provided by DuoLingo and translate it. In certain instances, you might receive slightly different sentences which is kind of cool to me.There are some exercises with sentences lacking punctuation marks at the end. In such cases, you may receive a sentence without proper structure. I haven't found a straightforward solution for this, so you can either skip these exercises or modify the script's logic and share it – that would be greatly appreciated.I hope you will enjoy using this shortcut!p.s.: If you found this shortcut useful and would like to support me, you can do so here:buymeacoffee.com😊0.83 - Sept. 5, 2023, 12:30 p.m.- thrash dictionary improvementLog inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackI created this shortcut so I could get better at learning some of the obscure words in Spelling Bee. I paired this with a Personal Automation that runs another Shortcut when I close Spelling Bee (see Spelling Bee Review for that Shortcut). It can be kind of frequent so some may prefer to run the review at a certain time of day or with some other trigger.Ok, so the shortcut was designed for taking a screenshot of the prior day words, but others may have better ways to get those words passed to Lookup.Once you screenshot, use the share sheet to select the shortcut, it will use OCR to generate a list of those words. Simply tap the ones you missed or want to add, and it will send those words to a user defined Collection in Lookup (you’ll need to make a collection in Lookup and set that as the destination in the Shortcut settings).1.0 - May 16, 2023, 2:33 p.m.An inelegant solution (probably) but works for meLog inorsign upto leave feedback.No feedback yet

It might take a few more seconds than before but it’s due to the more lines of code to get around YouTube’s protection.Also you will need to signup on www.rapidapi.com and get a FREE API KEY to download the protected videos/music.You will be prompted to set that api key up upon first run and you will never be bothered with it again.Another thing I forgot to mention is you can listen to all your downloaded songs from within this shortcut or you can open them up in VLC from within this shortcut if you have the app installed.Enjoy!!!Log inorsign upto leave feedback.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackSince Biology deals with religion and religious beliefs, not many students in the USA are very religious and poorly at understanding theological concepts. When the professors give them assignments regarding Biology, many of them fail at the subject due to a lack of knowledge on the particular subject. Also, the students don't observe the correct information while understanding the concepts in Biology.So, students in the USA are looking forBiology assignment help services, and by using the services, they have benefited a lot. The assignment help services give them the best-quality assignment on Biology, which results in good grades.What Do You Mean By Biology?The word "Biology" is derived from the Greek word meaning the study of God and religious practices. "Theo" is God, and the word "logy" is the study of something. It is an ancient Greek word meaning systematic study of God and religious faith, practices, and applications. Universities, institutes, and seminars teach this topic in academic disciplines.This topic gives a brief explanation of supernatural power and explains life beyond the universe. The study of Biology helps people deeply understand their and other religious traditions. It also explores the nature of divinity without any reference to a specific tradition.Why Do Students Seek Help From Assignment Helpers?Many students in the USA are doing odd jobs and studying at respective institutes and universities, so studying Biology and understanding its concepts deeply seems impossible to them. Some students try to complete it but fail because they must submit the assignment before the deadline. This creates a wrong impression, and late submission results in poor grades.Due to this reason, students in the USA are seeking an alternative way to complete their Biology assignments. That's why assignment help services are available in the USA; they help students achieve their assignments before the deadline.How Are Biology Assignment Help Services Beneficial?Writing Biology assignments is a daunting task for several students. Now, you have weighed your relief because the assignment help services themselves have experts in Biology and give us quality content in Biology assignments. The Biology papers by the assignment help services in the USA are written in such a way that it makes it easier to comprehend the Holy Bible too, and they are appropriately written and written in a way like teaching in the churches.Biology involves philosophy, history, religion, and the teachings and practices of faith in religion and God. Biology has close connections with the above-mentioned faiths. The theologians use explanation, arguments, and rationalism analysis while writing the assignment on Biology.Why Should Students Take Help From Assignment Helpers?As you know, assignments help services hire professionals in the field and SMEs to do Biology assignments. They usually give work to experts in Biology, i.e., theologians. Theologians should read the assignment, add suitable points, and submit the assignment very soon. Another advantage of getting help for Biology assignments from assignment help services is that they'll assist you 24/7.

- Description: DescriptionLatest Release NotesFeedbackChandrayaan-3 (transl. Moon-craft, pronunciation (help·info))[7] is the third Indian lunar exploration mission under the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Chandrayaan programme.[7] It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The propulsion module carried the lander and rover configuration to lunar orbit in preparation for a powered descent by the lander.[8][9]Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023.[10] The lander and rover landed at the lunar south pole region[11] on 23 August 2023 at 18:02 IST, making India the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole[12] and the fourth country to soft-land on the Moon.[4][13][14][15][16]Background
Further information: Chandrayaan programme
On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) launch vehicle consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover.[17] The lander was scheduled to touch down on the lunar surface in September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover. The lander ultimately crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land.[18][19]Following Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and further lunar missions were proposed.[20]The European Space Tracking network (ESTRACK), operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), is supporting the mission. Under a new cross-support arrangement, ESA tracking support could be provided for upcoming ISRO missions such as those of India's first human spaceflight programme, Gaganyaan, and the Aditya-L1 solar research mission. In return, future ESA missions will receive similar support from ISRO's own tracking stations.[21]Objectives
ISRO's mission objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission were:Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.
Observing and demonstrating the rover's driving capabilities on the Moon.
Conducting and observing experiments on the materials available on the lunar surface to better understand the composition of the Moon.[22]
Spacecraft
Design
Chandrayaan-3 comprised three main components:Propulsion module
The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration to a 100 kilometres (62 mi) lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with a large solar panel mounted on one side and a cylindrical mounting structure for the lander (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) on top.[9][8]
Lander
The Vikram lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters capable of producing 800 newtons of thrust each. It carries the rover and various scientific instruments to perform on-site analysis.[23][24]
The lander for Chandrayaan-3 has four variable-thrust engines with slew rate changing capabilities, unlike Chandrayaan-2's lander, which had five, with the fifth one being centrally mounted and capable only of fixed thrust. One of the main reasons for Chandrayaan-2 landing failure, attitude increase during the camera coasting phase, was removed by allowing the lander to control attitude and thrust during all phases of descent. Attitude correction rate is increased from Chandrayaan-2's 10°/s to 25°/s with Chandrayaan-3. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander will be equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to allow measuring attitude in 3 directions.[25][26] The impact legs have been made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and instrumentation redundancy has been improved. It will target a more precise 4 km (2.5 mi) by 4 km (2.5 mi) landing region based on images previously provided by the Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC) onboard Chandrayaan-2's orbiter. ISRO improved the structural rigidity, increased polling in instruments, increased data frequency and transmission, and added additional multiple contingency systems to improve lander survivability in the event of failures during descent and landing.[27][26]
Rover
The Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle with a mass of 26 kilograms (57 pounds). It is 917 millimetres (3.009 ft) x 750 millimetres (2.46 ft) x 397 millimetres (1.302 ft) in size.[28]
The rover is expected to take multiple measurements to support research into the composition of the lunar surface, the presence of water ice in the lunar soil, the history of lunar impacts, and the evolution of the Moon's atmosphere.[29][11]

LaunchLVM3 M4, Chandrayaan-3 – Launch vehicle lifting off from the second launch pad of SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota
Chandrayaan-3 was launched aboard an LVM3-M4 rocket on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, entering an Earth parking orbit with a perigee of 170 km (106 mi) and an apogee of 36,500 km (22,680 mi).Orbit
After a series of manoeuvres that placed Chandrayaan-3 in a trans-lunar injection orbit,[31][32][33] ISRO performed a lunar-orbit insertion (LOI) on 5 August, successfully placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into orbit around the Moon. The LOI operation was carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC) located in Bengaluru.[34][35]On 17 August, the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module to begin the last phase of the mission.[36]Descent
On 23 August 2023, as the lander approached the low point of its orbit, its four engines fired as a braking manoeuvre at 30 kilometres (19 mi) above the Moon's surface. After 11.5 minutes, the lander was 7.2 km (4.5 miles) above the surface; it maintained its altitude for about 10 seconds, then stabilized itself using eight smaller thrusters and rotated from a horizontal to a vertical position while continuing its descent.It then used two of its four engines to slow its descent to roughly 150 metres (490 ft); it hovered there for about 30 seconds before continuing downward and touching down at 12:32 UTC.[37][38]Stages of Chandrayaan-3 deployment and flight
