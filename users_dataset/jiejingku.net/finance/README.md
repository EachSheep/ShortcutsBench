OneKey originated as a hardware wallet, but with business development, it has become a feature-rich comprehensive cryptocurrency management tool. According to third-party statistics, OneKey currently hosts billions of dollars in cryptocurrency assets. This time entering the virtual card business, the promotional activities during the public testing period are still significant. No, but we recommend using the OneKey hardware wallet to manage your digital assets and recharge the funds to your OneKey Card account when needed for spending. No, you only need to register or log in to the OneKey Card website, complete identity verification, recharge the digital asset address of the card you own for use, and it will be converted into USD for spending according to the exchange rate at the time of recharge. During the public testing phase, only USDC recharge is available, and we cannot resolve recharging with the wrong token. It is not. This is a prepaid card and cannot be overdrawn. Before your funds are transferred from the OneKey wallet, they remain assets in self-custody mode. Once transferred to the OneKey Card account, they will no longer be in self-custody mode. When digital assets are received in the OneKey Card account, they will be converted to USD and transferred to the issuing institution, such as Visa or MasterCard. There is no limit on the amount, and the single transaction limit is 50000 USD. The address at 5 W 5th St Room 34027 Los Angeles, CA 90013 is the initial address of the card 4288 and can be used for filling in the billing address. Currently, this card segment does not support Apple Pay, but we will introduce cards that support Apple Pay later. If you have registered with a domestic identity and completed WeChat identity verification, you can check your junk mailbox or intercepted emails. If not found, please contact our staff and provide your registered email for further assistance. OneKey Card is a virtual debit card and does not affect credit.
