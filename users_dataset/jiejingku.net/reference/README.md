- Description: A simple and practical web-based foreign language vocabulary spelling learning tool. The software is designed for keyboard users whose main working language is English. Some people may type faster in their native language than in English because years of input in their native language have developed very strong muscle memory, while muscle memory for English input is relatively weaker, making it easier to forget words when typing in English. To improve English skills, continuous vocabulary memorization is also needed. This software combines the memorization of English words with the muscle memory training for English keyboard input, helping to strengthen muscle memory while memorizing words. To avoid incorrect muscle memory, if a user inputs a word incorrectly, they will need to retype it, as much as possible to ensure that the user maintains the correct muscle memory. The software also provides some assistance to individuals who need to take English exams. It includes a library of commonly used words in programmer's work, making it easy to practice common words used in work and improve typing speed. It also includes exercises for APIs in various languages to help programmers quickly become familiar with common APIs, with more languages' APIs gradually being added...
