- Description: A simple and practical web-based foreign language vocabulary spelling learning tool. The software is designed for keyboard users who primarily use English as their working language. Some people may type faster in their native language than in English, because years of typing in their mother tongue have built a strong muscle memory, while the muscle memory for typing in English is relatively weaker, leading to situations where they may forget how to write certain words when typing in English. In order to strengthen English skills, continuous vocabulary memorization is also necessary. This software combines the memory of English words with the muscle memory of typing on an English keyboard, allowing users to consolidate muscle memory while memorizing words. To prevent incorrect muscle memory, the design requires users to retype words if input incorrectly, ensuring users maintain the correct muscle memory as much as possible. The software also provides assistance to those who need to take English tests. It includes a library of commonly used words for programmers, making it convenient to practice common words used in work and improve typing speed. It also includes exercises for various language APIs, helping programmers quickly become familiar with common APIs, with more language APIs gradually being added.
